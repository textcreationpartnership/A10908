            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD GEORGE, LORD Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> His Honourable DIOCESAN.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reverend Father in God, and my Honourable Lord, my booke I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate unto God, as I have my ſelfe, and all my labours long ſince. I preſent it to your Lordſhip, as the perſon to whom under God and the King, I am bound to give an account of my life, and labours in my vocation. A beneficed man, and a Preacher I have lived in your Dioceſſe theſe thirty yeares; many conferences I have had with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; many ſmall tracts have I written, upon the requeſt of ſome of our Church, who deſired ſatisfaction in ſome points; diverſe bookes have I briefly anſwered with marginall notes, or analyticall reſolution of their diſcourſe, intending them for private ſatisfaction. Only one eſcaped that happineſſe of privacy, a ſhort anſwer
<pb facs="tcp:16580:3"/>
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which I gave, being in London, far from my bookes, farther from repoſe or quietneſſe to ſtudy, in a caſe, which made me fall on my knees, and pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to keepe to me the beſt things, whereby I might doe him ſervice. <hi>In maximis anguſtiis,</hi> I wrote that ſhort anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſher.</hi> I may call it my <hi>Benoni,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> or one for him, made a reply: and this is my defence of it, and our Church. It is not any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that I have of my labours, or my owne ſtrength, that cauſeth mee to publiſh it; no, I ſay to my ſelfe, as was ſaid to a weake Souldier, that girte on his armour to goe and fight:
<q>
                  <l>Non tali auxilio, nec defenſoribus iſtis</l>
                  <l>Tempus eget—</l>
               </q>
And, God be thanked, we have many better, and thoſe of late, whoſe workes for ſubject, and conformity of opinions, have that correſpondency with this of mine, though for acuteneſſe and learning beyond it, as that, amongſt other motives, cauſed me to publiſh it ſeven or eight yeares, after that it was finiſhed. The bragging of the Romaniſt, their falſe hopes of the change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the vaine feares of others, have made me rub up my old harneſſe, and to gird me to the battell, not daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the inſolency of ſome Papiſts, nor diſquieted with the cauſeleſſe feares of ſome of our ſide, who, while they would ſeeme zealous againſt the Roman party, little conſider, by their injurious traducing the Church they are members of, and the happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, that they help their enemies more then their moſt profeſſed Champions. For my part, as I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Sermon before your Lordſhip, at your firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, I am aſſured, that while we have the Scriptures, publike and private, in our mother tongue, and ſolid
<pb facs="tcp:16580:3"/>
Catechizing in the fundamentall points, wee need not feare Popery. This they well knew, that perſecuted with Fier and Fagot, whoſoever had the New Teſtament, or Old, or as much as the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the tenne Commandements in the Engliſh Tongue; they well knew, that to reade the Scriptures, and there finding, there is one Mediator betweene God and man, the man CHRIST IESUS, would make them that read it, though ſimple, to ſuſpect the popiſh mediation of Saints departed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The learning of the Lords Prayer, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction pray thus, <hi>Our Father,</hi> would make the ſimpleſt to collect after this manner; if I may goe to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and am ſo commanded by Chriſt, and have the example of the Patriarkes, Prophets, and Apoſtles praying unto God, and not unto men or Angels, with a promiſe from Chriſt, <hi>Aske and you ſhall have;</hi> and an invitation, <hi>Come unto me all ye that travaile, and are heavy laden, and I will refreſh you;</hi> why ſhould I pray unto Saints without command, promiſe or patterne, nay, without faith, <hi>how ſhall they call on him, on whom they have not beleeved? In quem non crediderunt,</hi> Vnleſſe they will ſay, which is a degree beyond ordinary Popery, that we may <hi>credere in hominem, vel Angelum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Creed being learned would make the ſimple conſider, when hee heareth of other Articles of Faith not therein contained, as traditions unwritten equalled to the words of God, the Popes ſupremacy, to be the prime article of the faith, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to <hi>Blackwell</hi> doth call it, tranſubſtantiation, invocation of Saints, veneration of Images, purgatory, ſeven Sacraments, <hi>Et quicquid novi ſemper apportat Roma,</hi> new articles, new monſters; to ſay thus, they are not in my Creed, it was
<pb facs="tcp:16580:4"/>
no part of my promiſe in Baptiſme, no covenants of mine: I was made a Chriſtian, without any ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, any ſuch articles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Commandements, the ſimple doe finde the Papiſts forgery, if they blot out the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or any part thereof: or their Idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Images, if they leave the text whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Having the whole Scriptures in their mother tongue, they finde the Papiſts prohibiting of marriage, and of meates, a doctrine of divels; their exerciſe of Religion in an unknowne tongue, to be but a tinckling Cymball; Antichriſt to bee that man of ſinne, which exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, to be the Whore that ſitteth on ſeven hils, that ſitteth in the Temple of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things being commanded by the King, and earneſtly preſſed by the Biſhops in their ſeverall Viſitations; make mee confident (as every moderate perſon is) that they, whoſe zeale againſt Rome is good, doe feare the alteration of Religion without cauſe; nay, have much to anſwer for both to God and man, for cheriſhing ſuch unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſuſpitions in themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Three things in your Lordſhips Viſitation, did cauſe me much to reverence your perſon, and place. 1. Your perſonall preſence in moſt parts of Your Dioceſſe. 2. Your admonition to the Miniſters, to ſtudy and preach the Scriptures, and to Catechize carefully. 3. Your Lordſhips laying of hands upon Children, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Your Lordſhip had examined ſome by Your ſelfe, and the reſt by Your Clergy; a thing of late neglected, and therefore lay heavie upon Your Lordſhip at this firſt comming, when there came ſo many, that Your
<pb facs="tcp:16580:4"/>
Lordſhips ſpirits were almoſt ſpent, and many were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cruſhed with the thronge; I ſaid then to Your Lordſhip, it was a great comfort to ſee the Church thus to ſuffer violence. And from all other violence the Lord of heaven deliver us: to whoſe protection my prayers daily commend Your Lordſhip;</p>

Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> delivered to divers Parſonages of good qualitie, certaine propoſitions concerning the Proteſtant Faith, Church, and Succeſsion; to which (though then farre from home, and from my Bookes) I gave a ſhort Anſwer, with a Catalogue of Orthodox Writers, who profeſſed our Faith in the firſt 700 yeares.

                  <p>The firſt thing I requeſted here of M. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> was to define a viſible Church, and to explaine an ambiguous phraſe, both as neceſſary grounds as may be for diſcourſe: for ambiguities are thickets wherein Sophiſters doe hide themſelves, and the firſt grand fallacy which they uſe, who would deceive others, and doe often deceive themſelves; neither is the Reſpondent bound by Rules of Art to anſwer ſuch an Opponent.</p>

                  <p>To this M. <hi>Fiſher</hi> or his Second have made no reply, not as much as to ſay, whether that will ſerve their turne, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt ſhew the names of Proteſtants in all ages. If this later, then may I require of M. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> or any other Ieſuit, to ſhew mee the names of Ieſuits in all ages, whoſe name began within theſe hundred yeares, or not much more, and for defect of ſuch names argue againſt them thus:
<q>
                        <p>They who are of the Church can ſhew their names to have been in all ages ſince Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>But no man can ſhew the name of Ieſuits to have been in all ages ſince Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ergo:</hi> No Ieſuite is of the Church.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I ſhould call upon you for the names of Ieſuits, I ſhould ſerve you as you ſerve us: but I wil not uſe ſuch poore miſerable ſhifts as theſe, which are no other then the cavils of men that have nothing to ſay that is worth the hearing, as I will after ſhew in his due place. Let this ſuffice for this place; I profeſſe, that if Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> or any other Ieſuit can ſhew me, that a Church profeſſing the ſame faith which the Ieſuits now doe, was viſible in all ages, I will be of their faith, though they can not ſhew me the names of Ieſuits in thoſe former times.</p>

               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> you here confound two Propoſitions, or Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, delivering them both as one, whereas they are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and may ſubſiſt the one without the other. For a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church may bee extant in all ages, and yet no names of the Profeſſors to be found for every age; and this exiſtence of ſuch a Church may be proved by generall teſtimony of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that the Chriſtian Religion was here in Britaine before the comming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monke,<note place="margin">Hist.

                  </gap>. It is not well to require one anſwer to two queſtions. This is as if a man ſhould aske whether <hi>Iohn a Nox,</hi> and <hi>Iohn a Stiles</hi> be at home, when the one is forth, the other at home; and enjoyne the Reſpondent to anſwer to both at once yea, or no; by which anſwer he muſt ſpeake an untruth, becauſe the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16580:12"/>
queſtions are two really diſtinct. This is a trick of Sophiſtry, M. <hi>Fiſher;</hi> let me give you one inſtance more. If I ſhould aske M. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> whether hee were a man, or not; and whether hee could ſhew mee the names of his Anceſtors in all ages untill <hi>Adam?</hi> would you give me one anſwer unto both? if affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, then you had a great taske, and ſuch as I think you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can performe, nor would undertake: if negative were your anſwer to both, then you are no man. You would think it unreaſonable that I ſhould tye you thus to prove your ſelfe a man. Thinke it as unreaſonable, that you ſhould tye me thus to ſhew my ſelfe a Chriſtian, eſpecially conſidering this kind of proofe is but weake, uncertaine, full of exceptions, and at the moſt but humane, <hi>Cui poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> the teſtimonies of men, <hi>qui &amp; falli poſſunt, &amp; fallere,</hi> who may deceive, and be deceived.</p>
               <p>You would thinke it reaſonable, that if you were to prove your ſelfe a man, a humane creature, or that you are deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> I ſhould leave the maner of proofe to your ſelf, &amp; you would go to work a ſhorter way, &amp; more effectually thus:
<q>
                     <p>Every living creature conſiſting of a reaſonable ſoule and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodie, is a man.</p>
                     <p>I am a living creature conſiſting of ſuch a ſoule, and ſuch a bodie:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo:</hi> I am a man.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This would give me ſatisfaction, I would not reject it, and bid you ſhew the names of your Anceſtors out of Hiſtories in all ages, or you are no man.</p>
               <p>You would have me prove my ſelfe a Chriſtian: give me leave to chuſe, and frame mine owne Argument thus:
<q>
                     <p>Whoſoever doth profeſſe that faith which is, and ever hath bin required of thoſe who by Baptiſme are made Chriſtians, is therein baptized, &amp; doth therin continue, is a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But I was baptized in that faith, and doe therein continue, and profeſſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo:</hi> I am a Christian.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Will you now, M. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> ſay unto mee, Not ſo; but you muſt ſhew me a Catalogue of thoſe who held your faith in all ages, or you are no Chriſtian, you have no Church. Is this

your charitie, M. <hi>Fiſher?</hi> will you not grant me as a Chriſtian? what I grant you as a man?</p>

Therefore as farre as concernes thoſe prime objects of mans beliefe which are the Articles of Faith, a man muſt beleeve the ſame expreſly, as hee muſt have Faith. But as for other objects of Faith a man is not bound to believe them expreſly, but onely impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely, or in a preparation of minde to belieue whatſoever is contained in the holy Scripture: but then he is bound to belieue thoſe things expreſſely, when it ſhall plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unto him that they are contained in the <hi>doctrine of Faith.</hi> Thus farre that Schooleman.</p>

<q>
                     <p>Whoſoever was baptized into, and ſtill doth profeſſe a whole, full, perfect, true, ſufficient faith, is of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But the Proteſtants were baptized into, and ſtill doe profeſſe a whole, full, perfect, true, ſufficient faith.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Proteſtants are of the Church.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Every word of the Major and Minor is prooved in this Chapter, in that I have proved all theſe titles to belong to the Apoſtles Creed.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whoſoever doe profeſſe that Faith by which men are made Chriſtians, doe ſtill continue Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But the Proteſtants doe profeſſe that faith by which men are made Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Proteſtants are Chriſtians, and conſequently of the Church.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A third Argument.</p>
               <p>To prove that thoſe Doctrines of their new Creed can be no Articles of faith, becauſe the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed being already perfect and compleat, can admit of no eſſentiall addition; and all Articles muſt be eſſentiall, <hi>quia per ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>There can be no eſſentiall addition to that which is perfect and compleat, as the Apoſtles Creed is.</p>
                  <p>But the Articles of Faith are eſſentiall unto Faith.</p>

               <p>If neither of ſaving Faith, nor any other, then of Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, no diviſion of things contained in Scripture is more frequent amongſt Fathers, Schoolemen, and latter Writers, Roman, &amp; Reformed then that of Faith and life, <hi>Credenda, &amp; facienda;</hi> what we ſhould beleeue, how wee ſhould liue; and if they be members of one diviſion they cannot bee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one of another.</p>

Let us heare the words of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying, ſo it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day. Here the head it ſelfe is ſhewed unto us, which gave himſelfe to bee handled by his diſciples. See what hee addeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning his body, which is the church, that ſo we may erre nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Bridegrome, nor in his Bride. And (ſaith he) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould be preached in his Name through all nations, beginning at Hieruſalem. What can be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more truly, more divinely, more clearly? I hold my words unworthy to commend it, and yet theſe Heretikes are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to oppugne it. They may ſay that thoſe words which I have cited out of the Law, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16580:28"/>
the Prophets, &amp; the Pſalmes, are darkly &amp; figuratively ſpoken, &amp; may be otherwiſe underſtood; although I have laboured herein to ſtop their mouthes. But ſay they ſhould ſay ſo, I aske again, whether that be darkly ſpoken, or ſhadowed with a vaile, as if it were a riddle w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was ſpoken by Chriſt himſelfe, that ſo it is written, and ſo Chriſt ought to ſuffer, and to riſe again the third day, &amp; that repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched amongſt all nations in his name.

               <p>Secondly, let us obſerve, that this Father writing upon this Queſtion, ſo many Books as make more then halfe a great Tome, yet never uſed any other Argument in thoſe Bookes but Scripture; hee never called upon his Adverſaries, to ſhew names of their Profeſſors in all Ages, nor did hee attempt that for himſelfe, but choſe rather to cite the ſame Scriptures, twenty times at leaſt in ſeverall Bookes of that ſubject, out of which places I will collect two Arguments; firſt, deſiring the Reader to obſerve, That things expreſly contained in Scriptures, and things thence deduced are of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, theſe later inferior to thoſe; thoſe are Principles, theſe are but Concluſions; thoſe depend upon ſupernaturall light of Divine Revelation, theſe Concluſions are grounded upon thoſe Divine Principles which men apprehend by Faith, and then doe ſearch, and find the illation, and conſequence of theſe Concluſions by the light of naturall reaſon, improved by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and refined by Art: I doe not ſay that I can ſhew in Scripture, that the Proteſtants are the true Church, which were to make it a point of Faith, but out of Scriptures I can prove that the Proteſtants are a Church, and ſo make it a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall concluſion, and the Arguments demonſtrations; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe drawne out of the proper Principles of Theologie or Divinitie, thus:</p>
               <p>1. Argument.</p>
               <p>They who profeſſe that Faith which was preached through the World, are a true Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:16580:29"/>But the Proteſtants holding the Apoſtles Creed, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtles, doe profeſſe that Faith which was preached through the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Proteſtants are a true Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>2. Argument.</p>
               <p>They who hold Communion, and acknowledge themſelves to be a part of that Church which is diſperſed through the World, are a true Church.</p>
               <p>But the Proteſtants doe hold Communion, and acknowledge themſelves to bee a part of that Church which is diſperſed through the World.</p>
               <p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>1. Argument.</p>
               <p>The Church doth profeſſe that Faith which was preached, and received through the World.</p>
               <p>The Roman Church holding a new Creed of unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Tranſubſtantiation, worſhipping of Images, &amp;c. doe therein not profeſſe that Faith which was preached, and received through the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church of Rome is not the Church.</p>
               <p>2. Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chriſtian Church hath many more Children then the Church of the Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Romane Church hath not more Children then the Church of the Iewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>The Roman Church is not the Chriſtian Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth bring out of Scripture in thoſe words, <hi>The barren hath many more children then ſhee that hath an husband.</hi> The Minor will appeare, if we ſay unto theſe Romaniſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the grounds I layed, doe manifeſt to the learned indifferent Reader, that I did ſo intrench my ſelfe, ſo fortifie my cauſe, as that I feare not any open force of a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enemie then you are. <hi>I named for Proteſtants, knowne Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicks</hi> (ſay you) diſtinguiſh Romane Catholicks, whether you meane the preſent Romane Church, or that which was in the firſt ſeven hundred yeares: theſe two are as different as Chriſtian, and Antichriſtian, as Orthodox,<note place="margin">

They of thoſe firſt ſeven hundred yeares did not equall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions unto the Word of God, they did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Images, nor was your new Creed any part of their Faith; and this is the reaſon why we oppoſe the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe ſhe hath ſo far declined from what ſhe was.</p>
               <p>Returne you to that Primitive Romane Church, and wee will returne to you; theſe Writers of the firſt ſeven hundred yeares are ours, and not yours: inſomuch, that I doe require
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16580:31"/>
you to ſhew me any one Father of thoſe ſeven hundred yeares that held your now Romane Creed, and I will be of your mind. And whereas you make choice of Saint <hi>Bede</hi> for your inſtance, I will pitch upon that very man, and deny him to be of your now Romane Faith, I meane, as farre as your now Romane Church doth differ from other Chriſtian Churches: herein I am in the Negative, ſo that it doth belong to you to prove the Affirmative. Whereas you ſay Saint <hi>Bedes</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and profeſſion of life (being a profeſſed Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Monke) ſhewes him to be no Proteſtant; firſt, for his Writings, ſhew mee out of his Writings, what part of the Apoſtles Creed hee did denie; I have no other Articles of Faith: if hee held theſe (as I know hee did, and his Writings doe manifeſt it) hee is of my Faith, hee is of my Church; I of his, both of one Church, both of that one Faith, which the Proteſtants doe profeſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I beleeve all the revealed written Word of God, as it was received in the Primitive Church, doth Saint <hi>Bede</hi> deny any of theſe? ſhew mee where. <hi>But</hi> (ſay you) <hi>his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of life proves him to be no Proteſtant, for hee was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicke Monke.</hi> Firſt, as for <hi>Roman,</hi> I have already anſwered, that your preſent Romane Church differs from that which then was, in all thoſe Doctrines wherein we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from you, although it then began in matters of Diſcipline to ſwerve from what it had beene, I ſay in matters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, not of Doctrine; if in any Doctrine, not in Doctrines of Faith; they enacted, enjoyned, neceſſitated no new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as now you have done in your Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> whereas you adde Catholick to Roman. <hi>Hoc eſt— Pugnantia ſecum frontibus adverſis componere,</hi> like that of dividing all the world into <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> or rather to ſay that <hi>Kent</hi> is all <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> Roman is but a part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and to ſay as you doe, that the Roman is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, is as if one ſhould ſay that one particular man were all men, and that one limbe of a man were the man, as the Poet ſaid of <hi>Tongilianus:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Tongilianus</hi> habet naſum, ſcio, nec nego naſum,</l>

Whereupon one <hi>Vrbicus</hi> wrote againſt thoſe that did not faſt upon Saturday, which cauſed one <hi>Caſſalanus</hi> a Presbyter to write unto Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> requeſting his reſolution herein, who replying unto him ſaith; In thoſe things concerning the which the word of God doth not lay downe any certaine rule, the cuſtome of Gods people, the ordinances of their Anceſtors are to be held for a law, He did not ſay heere the decrees, or cuſtome of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt ſtand for a law to all other Churches. He bids him obſerve the words of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbicus,</hi> and you ſhall ſee him (ſaith he) with moſt injurious termes to abuſe <hi>penè univerſam Eccleſiam Chriſti ab ortu Solis uſque ad occaſum,</hi> almoſt all the Church of Chriſt from the riſing of the Sunne to the ſetting of the ſame; meaning thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that here this Father did diſtinguiſh the univerſall Church from the Roman, And againe the queſtion is (ſaith he) <hi>Vtrum Sabbato jejunandum ſit?</hi> whether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to faſt upon the Saturday? which queſtion I would he did ſo demand, or ſo affirme as not openly to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Church diſperſed over the circumference of the Earth except the Roman, and ſome few more of the Weſt. And againe in the ſame Epiſtle he ſaith: <hi>Non tibi perſuade at urbem Chriſtianam ſic laudare Sabbato jejunantem, ut cogaris orbem Christianum daemnare praudentem.</hi> Let him not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee ſo to commend a Chriſtian City (viz. <hi>Rome</hi>) fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting on the Saturday, as to cauſe thee to condemne the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world denying that day. Here <hi>Rome</hi> was a Chriſtian City, but the Church beſides is termed the Chriſtian world, Seeing then that the Roman Church is but a part, ſay not that it is the whole Church out of which no man can be ſaved. This was the claime of <hi>Donatus,</hi> and ſome of his diſtracted fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to ſtile themſelves the whole Church, as you do, they being as you are in proportion to the Catholike Church, that is the whole Church but <hi>fruſtum de fruſto majore preciſum,</hi> a part of that Weſterne Church which was but a part of that Catholike Church, of the whole Church.

principles that are in the world, which every child under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, and doth aſſent unto: if he be but ſeven yeers old, viz. That <hi>Omne totum eſt majus aliqua ſua parte;</hi> the whole is greater then any part thereof; a child knowes this ſooner then he knowes the right hand from the left: divide him an apple, and aske him whether he will have all or a peece? he will ſay all, aske why? he will ſay it is more. Divide him his bread, and butter in peeces, and aske him whether he will have a part or the whole? he will chuſe the whole becauſe it is the bigger. The Roman Church is not the Aethiopian Church, nor the Greeke Church, nor the Armenian, Neſtorian, Indian Church, all theſe and many more are but parts of the Catholike Church, Will you ſay that any part of this whole Church is as bigge as the whole? A greater degree of ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity then this did I never reade, or heere of. Would you make us leſſe then children, more ſimple then infants? When you tell us of your Roman Catholike Church, in that ſenſe you expound it, not as concurring with but including the whole Catholike Church: Thus much for making the Catholike Church to be <hi>the Roman Church. Rome</hi> was a ſound, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part, and member of the Church before the ſeventh age, but in that age it began to bee troubled with the head-ach, when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> claimed that proud ſwelling title of univerſall Biſhop, which <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; in ſucceeding times that Church became heart-ſick, and more diſeaſed (I ſpeake as I conceive) then any one emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent member of the Catholike Church; her diſeaſes, her he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, her uſurpations, innovations, ſuperſtitions, Idolatries we have left, that is her Papacie, not that faith by which ſhe was, and is a Church though diſeaſed, ſick, all over infected with a leproſie; as I would ſhunne a man that is a leper, and yet not deny him to be a man. But <hi>Beda</hi> was a member of the Catholike Church, of the Roman Church ſuch as then it was, not ſuch as now it is; hee was not ſicke of your greateſt diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Neither is your Argument of force as it is drawne from the title of Monke, no more then if I ſhould conclude him to be of my religion, only by ſaying that he was a Presbyter of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16580:33"/>

                  <p>All Roman Monkes of all ages are of one faith, of one Church.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo, Beda</hi> was of the ſame faith and Church with me, and all other Presbyters of the now Engliſh Church.</p>

               <p>This is your kind of arguing, ſillie, and ſimple. The major is moſt falſe, a meere aequivocation, the Monkes of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church agreeing with your Monkes only in name, but not in nature, in ſignification, in definition.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> did cite a Heathen to perſwade Heathens, yea the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Altar dedicated to the unknowne God, found amongſt Heathen Idolls.

Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> or his Second would have exclaimed hereat ſaying, what meaneſt thou <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> wilt thou perſwade mee that the Iewes are Chriſtians? if not why citeſt thou their bookes? nay, what meaneſt thou <hi>Paul</hi> to cite the Greeke Poets? wouldſt thou perſwade me that they are Chriſtians; as if it muſt follow that they whoſe teſtimonie we cite in ſome things, muſt be our friends in all.</p>
               <p>All the faith of the Proteſtants is confirmed by the Papiſts, all their explicite, all their implicite faith, all that belongs to our faith <hi>vel per ſe, vel per accidens</hi> eſſentially, or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, primarie, or ſecundarily, as an Article of faith, or as an illuſtration of the ſame expreſſed in Scripture: and yet the Proteſtants are no Papiſts, the Papiſts are no Proteſtants: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Papiſts have a new Creed, which Proteſtants deny, and I call God to witneſſe that I deſire to die a thouſand deaths rather then to approve it, becauſe I aſſure me it is falſe in all, and in ſome things blaſphemous, The Papiſts have ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion, worſhipping of Images, praying to Saints which I abhorre as being Idolatry. In diſcipline alſo they have ſuch tenents of abſolute ſupreme power over Biſhops, Kings, Lawes, oathes, as is full of pride, ſedition, uſurpation, and impiety.</p>

               <p>After theſe, all doctrines, and lawes Eccleſiaſticall, or civill in the Church or State wherein I live, not contradicting the word of God, or my conſcience I receive with humility.

Whence it comes to paſſe that ſome are of the ſoule and of the body of the Church, and therefore united to Chriſt their Head both inwardly, and outwardly; theſe are moſt perfectly of the Church, for they are as living members in the body.

Laſtly ſome are of the body but not of the ſoule, as thoſe who have no inward vertue, but for ſome temporall ends do profeſſe the faith, and partake of the Sacraments under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Paſtors, and ſuch are as the haire, or nailes, or ill humors in mans body, Thus farre Saint <hi>Augustine.</hi>

               <p>As then in man there is the inner, and the outward man; the ſoule and the body; the one is viſible, the other is not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: So in the Church there is a myſticall Church which is not ſeene to bodily eyes, and an outward profeſſion of Chriſt, and receiving of Sacraments which makes the viſible Church; we can ſee the men, we can ſee them baptized, comming to the Temple, receiving the Sacraments; we can heare them make confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, call upon God the Father by Chriſt; all theſe things are ſenſible and moſt of them viſible as the men, their meeting, their receiving of the Sacraments, the lifting up of their hands in prayer, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                           <p>The baptiſme is Chriſts, the rebaptizing is thine, I correct in thee that which is thine, and acknowledge that which is Chriſts; for this is juſt that when wee reproove the evils of men, we ſhould approve whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good things we find in them, becauſe they are Gods: I ſay, this is juſt, that even in a ſacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I ſhould not violate that true Sacrament which I find in him: neither that I ſhould ſo correct a ſacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as thereby to commit a ſacrilegious ſinne.</p>

                           <p>Wee alſo diſſwade him from thoſe errors whereby he ſtill ſticketh to the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the old Sacraments, and we ſhew unto him that the time is come already, wherein the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that theſe things were to bee taken away, and changed.

               <p>Theſe words of this Father make ſo plaine for our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, as that they need no application, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der underſtand Papiſt, where he readeth Donatiſt, and he ſhall find the Argument to follow. We ſo left you as that we retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whatſoever you had from God, and reject that which was from man: we retained that which made you a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, we rejected that which made you Popiſh, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian.</p>
               <p>In the former we communicate with you, in the latter we diſclaime. So thoſe whom I have, and ſhall cite, did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with you in ſome things, but not in all; for if they had communicated with you in all things they would not have reproved,<note place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>2.</hi> cor. op.

                  </note> and diſliked ſo many things. <hi>Qui communicat, conſentit, qui conſentit corrumpitur.</hi> If hee communicate,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16580:39"/>
hee doth conſent, if hee conſent hee is corrupted.</p>
               <p>To conſent to evill is nothing elſe but to approve, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that which is evill; neither is there any man joyned in evill but he that doth commit evill, or favour it; act it, or approve it. In thoſe good men which are diſpleaſed with thoſe evills, the Church doth continue, hath continued, and will continue for ever. And as the graine unwinnowed is hid in the chaffe: So the godly doe not eaſily appeare amongſt a multitude of the wicked.</p>
               <p>The people may be good, where the Biſhops are bad; as the people were bad, though <hi>Moſes</hi> a good man was their Prince: where <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were, there alſo were ſacrilegious murtherers: Where <hi>Caiphas</hi> was, and many like unto him, there were alſo <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and others like unto them: <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were in the ſame Synagogue, &amp;c. So that I doubt not but ſome may be found in all ages, who did not communicate with your new doctrines, ſuperſtitious worſhip, tyrannicall diſcipline, although they did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with you in the Scriptures, and Apoſtles Creed, as wee and all the famous Chriſtian Churches in the world doe. Know then that whereas you ſay that the Fathers and others alleadged by ſome of your men did communicate with the Roman Church, unleſſe you can ſay in all things, you conclude nothing: <hi>Syllogizari non eſt ex particulari;</hi> for otherwiſe I might argue thus,

               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:16580:41"/>As if I ſhould ſay, If any Ieſuit will anſwer mee, let him ſhew mee the names of Ieſuit Preachers in all Ages, who taught the people Ieſuiticall Doctrine in every ſeverall Age, or elſe confeſſe that there were no ſuch before <hi>Ignatius Laio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi> We will deale with you as <hi>Edward</hi> the third with <hi>Phillip,</hi> who preſented himſelfe before <hi>Paris;</hi> ſaying, Hee did call upon him to open fight in the view of <hi>France,</hi> and before his great Theater of <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <p>That my ſuppoſitions are falſe, you ſay it; I deny it, when you ſhew any reaſon to convince them of falſhood, I will diſclaime them; If my definition bee bad, you ſhould have mended it, and ſo much I requeſted you to doe, and doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt it againe, and againe. But why is my definition bad? why my ſuppoſitions falſe? and why ſhifts? becauſe that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Anabaptiſts, or whatſoever other Sectarie may by the like, defend the ſame perſons to have beene of their Religion and Sect. What ſuppoſitions you meane I know not, if you meane my diſtinctions, I ſhall anſwer you when I come to your particular exception againſt them: As for my definition it was this, and thus delivered.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> I deſire you therefore to expreſſe without ambiguity the termes of this queſtion, whether the Proteſtant Church was viſible in all ages? what you meane by Church? what by Proteſtants? what by viſible?</p>
               <p>I will deliver my opinion in defining a Proteſtant Church. The Proteſtant Church is a ſociety of men profeſſing the faith expreſſed in the Canonicall Scriptures, acknowledged to be ſuch in the Primitive Church; comprized in the Apoſtles Creed, explained in the other two Creedes of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> miniſtring the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper by men of lawfull calling, and ordination.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Thus farre in my former Reply, this was the definition I brought, and none other. You ſay an Arrian may by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition defend, that thoſe perſons by me alleadged were of his Religion, or Sect, ſo may the Anabaptiſts, or any other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as you ſay; what other Sectaries you meane I know not; as for the Anabaptiſt, I will anſwer you where you have made more full mention of him. As for the Arrian, becauſe here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you name him, here I will reply unto you concerning him. You ſay that my definition may agree with an Arrian, for ſo it muſt if thereby he may proove thoſe to whom this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16580:43"/>
doth belong to be of his Religion, then which nothing could be ſpoken more ignorantly if you thought as you wrote, or more impudently if you knew the contrary, being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a truth, as nothing that ever happened in the Chriſtian Church is more frequent in Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in Councells, then that <hi>Arrius</hi> was condemned in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell; and the more full explication of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed was made in that Councell onely to exclude and condemne <hi>Arrius,</hi> which explication is commonly called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed: to the ſame purpoſe did <hi>Athanaſius</hi> compoſe his explication of the ſame Creed. I make mention of both theſe in my definition, ſaying that the Proteſtant Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that faith compriſed in the Apoſtles Creed, explained in the other two Creeds of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> All theſe three doe ſay, that Chriſt is God: <hi>Arrius</hi> doth deny it, theſe are contradictories, can you reconcile them? if you can, you will doe more then all the Divines, all the Philoſophers could doe, nay more then God himſelfe can doe. The Apoſtles Creed ſaith that Chriſt is the onely begotten Sonne of God, and therefore God, as the begotten Sonne of man is man: the <hi>onely begotten Sonne</hi> of God, becauſe he alone is the Sonne of God by generation, all others either by creation, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed ſaith, Chriſt is begotten of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Father, God of God, true God of true God. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed runnes wholly on the ſame ſtraine, that Chriſt is God, that hee is uncreate, eternall, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, Almighty; <hi>Arrius</hi> denyed all this in denying him to be God.</p>
               <p>This definition I alleadge, not as proper to the Proteſtants diſtinguiſhed from other Churches, but common to all true Chriſtian Churches, for two reaſons; firſt my drift is not to proove that onely the Proteſtants make the Church as I have fully expreſſed in my firſt Anſwer. My words ſpeaking to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſhers</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. propoſition, were theſe, I would gladly know what they meane by thoſe words (if the Proteſtants be <hi>the true viſible Church</hi>) whether ſo as if we alone (who are called Proteſtants) were of the Church and no others? wee
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16580:43"/>
leave ſuch encloſing of Commons to the Romaniſts; we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it not, we are <hi>a true Church, not the true Church:</hi> we are a part, not the whole: we include our ſelves, we exclude not others, whether <hi>Graecians, Armenians, Aethiopians, Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Italians, &amp;c.</hi> ſo they deny no fundamentall parts of the faith either directly or by conſequence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe there can be but one definition of one Church, and ſuch is the Catholick Church of Chriſt acknowledged to be, and this one definition muſt accord, and may be verified of every particular ſociety, that profeſſeth the faith of Chriſt, and miniſtreth thoſe Sacraments which were ordained by Chriſt as neceſſary unto all men under the government of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors; for theſe particular ſocieties are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the whole, <hi>Partes homogeneae quarum idem nomen cum toto, &amp; eadem nominis definitio;</hi> parts of one kind with the whole, and one with another, which have the ſame defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, becauſe they have the ſame nature, and eſſence, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drop of blood is blood, and every little peece of fleſh is fleſh, and have all the ſame definition. As therefore when I would proove my ſelfe to be a man, I would uſe no other definition then <hi>animal rationale,</hi> a reaſonable creature endued with a living ſenſible body,<note place="margin">Haec Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis lex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiendi.</note> for <hi>ſingularia non habent definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem niſi ſpeciei,</hi> particular, and individuall things have no proper, peculiar definition of their owne, but all of one kind, or <hi>ſpecies,</hi> have the ſame definition; ſo being to proove my ſelfe a Chriſtian, I will uſe no other definition then that of Chriſtians in generall, viz. that I hold the faith of Chriſt, am admitted by baptiſme into his viſible Church, wherein I doe continue under the direction, and government of my Paſtors.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould reply, that is no good definition, becauſe it belongeth to you of the Roman Church, to thoſe of the <hi>Greeke, Armenian, Aethiopian, Indian</hi> Churches, and to all other ſects of Chriſtians as well as to me; I anſwer, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it doe belong to all Chriſtians, it were no good definition, as <hi>animal rationale</hi> were no good definition of a man, unleſſe it did belong to every particular man, excluding none; for this is the rule of defining, this is the direction that is given
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16580:44"/>
by the moſt learned, that we muſt paſſe through every ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, obſerving what is to be found in them all, and at all times, and put thoſe things alone in our definition, excluding thoſe other things which we find in ſome ſingulars, or particulars, but not in other, or at ſometimes, but not at other. This is the rule of reaſon, but you of <hi>Rome</hi> contrary to this courſe in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming your definitions, have collected thoſe things which are to be found in one particular Church, viz. your owne, and wherein you conceive other particular Churches to be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, things accidentall to the Church, as without which the Chriſtian Church hath beene, and may be hereafter; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all thoſe things that belong to the definition of any thing, muſt be eſſentiall, univerſall, inſeparable; and being taken all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together muſt ſhew, and explicate the whole nature of the thing, and exclude all things elſe of a different nature or kind: as for example, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> after a long diſpute concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the definition of the Church, rejecting all other, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus.</p>

not two, and that one and true Church is an Aſſembly of men knit together in the profeſſion of the ſame faith with Chriſt, and Communion of the ſame Sacraments under the government of lawfull Paſtors, and eſpecially under one Vicar of Chriſt on Earth the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Out of which definition may eaſily bee collected who are of the Church, and who are not; for in this definition are three parts, 1. profeſſion of faith; 2. communion of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 3. ſubjection to a lawfull Paſtor, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> The 1. of theſe doth exclude all Infidells aſwell Iewes, Turkes and Heathens, as Heretickes, and Apoſtates which having beene of the Church departed from it.

I will end this with an Hiſtorian, and Traveller of your owne, <hi>Andrew Thevet,</hi> Coſmographer to the French King in his Coſmographie: I aſſure you (ſaith he) that I found at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the holy (Paſſion) weeke, more then foure thouſand Chriſtians of ſeverall (remote) Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my ſelfe being ſole with an Almaine of the Roman Church. And anon after hee ſaith, All thoſe Nations doe acknowledge neither Pope, nor Cardinall, King nor Emperour of ours. And againe, None can ſhew that the Abyſſines, Armenians, Maronits, Georgians of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Iacobites, Syrians, Iavans, which be of the Ilands next the Orientall <hi>India,</hi> Burians, Darians, Cephalians, the men of <hi>Quinſay,</hi> moſt remote of all the Orientall <hi>India</hi> (of all which Nations I ſaw in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the holy (Paſſion) weeke) ever learned from us (of the Latine Church) their Sacred Myſteries (or Liturgie) which they affirme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have received from the Apoſtles.

               <p>All the ſervice that the Romiſh Clergie of thoſe times did doe to the Devill, in bringing infinite numbers of ſoules to Hell, was nothing to what this Ieſuiticall definition, and Doctrine doth doe.</p>

                  <hi>2.</hi> This one infallible faith cannot be had according to the ordinary courſe of Gods providence, but by hearing Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and Paſtors of the true viſible Church, who onely are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſent, and authorized to teach the true word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> As therefore this one infallible faith hath beene, and muſt be in all ages, ſo there muſt needs be in all ages Preachers, and Paſtors of the true viſible Church, of whom all ſorts of people have in times paſt (as appeareth by Hiſtories) learned, and muſt learne in all future times the ſaid infallible faith.</p>

be found in Hiſtories, names of Proteſtant Preachers who in all ages did teach all ſorts of faithfull people, and who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeverall Nations unto the Chriſtian faith; Hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I ſay, that Proteſtants are not the true viſible Church of Chriſt, neither are their Preachers lawfully ſent, or ſufficiently authoriſed to teach; nor people ſecurely warranted to learne of them that one infallible faith, without which none can pleaſe God, nor (if they ſo live, and die) be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Here, (ſay you) is a true Copy of Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as if my Copy were not true. My Anſwer was printed without my knowledge, yet the Propoſitions of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſher</hi> printed, are agreeing unto theſe Copies which I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and there is nothing more in this your ſecond Edition, then was in thoſe alleadged by me, ſaving theſe few words <hi>(in Hiſtories as the names of thoſe are found)</hi> which make no ſentence nor fill up one poore little line, and if they ſtrengthen your cauſe any thing the more, let them come in, and doe you urge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rogers</hi> in his 1. Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The 3. firſt Propoſitions I admit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is one faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ordinary propagation of this faith is by Paſtors lawfully called.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there have beene, and muſt be in all ages ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſo called.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would gladly know what they meane by thoſe words, (if the Proteſtants be the true viſible Church) whether ſo, as if we alone (who are called Proteſtants) were of the Church, and no others? we have ſuch encloſing of Commons to the Romaniſts; we chalenge it not, wee are a true Church, not the true Church; we are a part, not the whole; wee include our ſelves, we exclude not others, whether <hi>Graecians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Aethiopians, Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Italians, &amp;c.</hi> So they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny no fundamentall parts of the faith, either directly, or by conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:16580:50"/>An examination of Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> anſwer to the five Propoſitions aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>I find firſt that he granted the firſt three without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which I deſire may bee diligently noted, and well pondered; for out of theſe three grounds, to wit; Firſt, that there is one, and but one Faith neceſſary to ſalvation. And ſecondly, that this faith (according to the ordinary courſe of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) cannot be had otherwiſe then by hearing the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or teaching, of lawfully ſent Paſtors. And thirdly, that this faith hath beene in all ages paſt (as appeareth by Hiſtories) taught by Paſtors of the true viſible Church, who onely are lawfully ſent. Out of theſe 3. grounds, I ſay, evidently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth Propoſition, to wit, If Proteſtant faith bee the true faith, and their Church the true Church, (or as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> had rather ſay, A true Church) of Chriſt, then their Proteſtant faith differing from the Roman faith hath beene taught in all ages by lawfully ſent viſible Proteſtant Paſtors, whoſe names may be found in Hiſtories, as names of others are found who did teach the true faith of Chriſt in all ages.</p>
               <p>This to follow, out of the aforeſaid three grounds, is as I ſaid, moſt evident,<note place="margin">Nego, it is falſe.</note> neither doth Maſter <hi>Rogers make any bones</hi> to grant, ſave onely that it may be hee will make a bogge at the word Hiſtories, as not finding it in his Copie, nor think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it perhaps neceſſary that the names of Proteſtant Paſtors, who taught the Proteſtant faith in all ages paſt be found in Hiſtories; but underſtanding the word Hiſtories, as Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> underſtood it, to wit for ſome or other kind of Record, or Monument, as Doct. <hi>White</hi> alſo underſtood it when he ſaid; Things paſt cannot be ſhewed but by Hiſtories; I doe not ſee why M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers</hi> may not abſolutely graunt the fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, even as it was ſet downe by Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> himſelfe; for if any viſible Proteſtant Paſtors were in all ages, teaching eſpecially any ſuch Proteſtant doctrines as now are taught, they would have beene named and ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Rogers all, or ſome.</note> and written of aſwell as others are, who have in all ages paſt taught all ſorts of true and falſe doctrines, in regard there cannot be aſſigned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16580:51"/>
any reaſon, either of the part of Gods providence, or humane diligence, why the name of others, even falſe teachers in all ages, ſhould be ſet downe, and preſerved in Hiſtories yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, rather then the names of ſuch as Proteſtants deeme to be the onely true Teachers of pure doctrine; for doubtleſſe both God, who is zealous of his honour, and carefull to honour and preſerve the memory of them that would honour him, would for his honours ſake have procured honourable memory of ſuch as did, by teaching truth, honour him; and men carefull of their ſoules health (which they cannot attaine according to the ordinary courſe, but by hearing ſuch Paſtors onely who have lawfull ſucceſſion from Chriſts Apoſtles) have reaſon diligently to looke that memory be preſerved of ſuch Paſtors, and of pure divine truth taught by them, then of others, who taught any other falſe, and not pure doctrine. Certaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that the names (or ſome thing equivalent to names) and the doctrines of true Paſtors who did in all ages paſt, teach true divine doctrine, may be found in Hiſtories, as well as the names, and doctrines of others are found who did teach any other doctrine. And therefore if Proteſtants have had any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors teaching true doctrines in all ages, doubtleſſe their names would be extant in Hiſtories yet extant, which being preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and granted, as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ſeemeth to grant, by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Propoſition I doe not ſee how Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> can denie Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> firſt Propoſition; for it being ſuppoſed that the Proteſtant Preachers were, their names would be found in Hiſtories (as Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition granteth by Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ſuppoſed) it may bee well inferred that if no ſuch mens names be found in Hiſtories, then no ſuch men were in all ages, nor conſequently are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants the true Church of Chriſt, for it hath had ſuch in all ages: I doe not therefore ſee, I ſay, how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers</hi> can deny M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fiſher</hi> his firſt Propoſition, ſuppoſing he grant as he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his fourth Propoſition; for although abſolutely ſpeaking, an Argument drawne from negative authority, be (as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> averreth) of it ſelfe of no force, and ſo Proteſtants Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which are uſually made againſt us out of negative authority.</p>

               <p>Here Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> I muſt requeſt you, and the Reader who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be to looke backe upon the title of the two laſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which is [Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> his moſt weake grounds] then reade diligently all that is there written, and ſee if there bee any mention, any one ſentence, any one word of any of my grounds. All that is here ſpoken is in defence of Maſter <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers</hi> owne grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> of his 4. and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Propoſition, which in that ſenſe that you enforc'd them, are moſt weake, and more weakly maintained, and therefore the title ſhould have beene thus,</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> his moſt weake grounds.</p>
               <p>That they are moſt weake grounds you ſay truly, that they are your grounds they manifeſt of themſelves, being your fourth, and fifth Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>I find firſt, that he granteth the firſt three without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which I deſire may be diligently noted, and well pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>How I admitted them appeareth by my anſwer, I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them more briefly, and more perſpicuouſly then you did, thus, and in this ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The three firſt Propoſitions I admit.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That there is one faith.</item>
                  <item>2. The ordinary propagation of this faith is by Paſtors lawfully called.</item>
                  <item>3. That there have beene, and muſt be in all ages, Paſtors ſo lawfully called.</item>
               </list>
               <p>This I conceived to be the meaning of your three firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions without any diminution, neither doe you except againſt it; as for your parentheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> (as appeareth by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories) that is no part of the Propoſition, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That is one Propoſition which declareth one thing, or whoſe parts are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16580:52"/>
and made one by conjunction: this your parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is no part of the Propoſition, nor made one with it by conjunction.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>For out of theſe three grounds (to wit firſt that there is one and but one faith neceſſary to ſalvation, Secondly, &amp;c. Evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth that which is Maſters <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth Propoſition, to wit; If Proteſtant faith be the true faith, and their Church the true Church (or as Master <hi>Rogers</hi> had rather ſay A true Church) of Chriſt, then their Proteſtant faith differing from the Roman faith hath beene taught in all ages by lawfully ſent viſible Proteſtant Pastors, whoſe names may be found in Hiſtories, as names of others are found who did teach the true faith of Chriſt in all ages.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>If it doth evidently follow, frame your Argument, make your ſyllogiſme, inferre your concluſion I ſee not the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; make it cleare unto me, one ſhort ſyllogiſme would make me confeſſe that which you endeavour to prove in three pages, but prove not at all, onely you make one <hi>fallacie</hi> called <hi>petitio principij,</hi> and falſifie my words more then once, I will begin with your falſifications.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Neither doth Maſter Rogers make any bones to grant.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>This is your firſt falſification, that I make no bones to grant your fourth Propoſition: what I granted in your fourth Propoſition was this; Firſt, after the Rules of Art, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all learned men in all profeſſions, and the onely way to wave contention about words, and come to reality; finding an ambiguous phraſe in that Propoſition I thus wrote, I would gladly know what they meane by thoſe words (if the Proteſtants bee the true viſible Church) whether ſo as if we alone (who are called Proteſtants) were of the Church,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16580:52"/>
and no others? wee leave ſuch encloſing of Commons to the Romaniſts, wee challenge it not, wee are a true Church, not the true Church; wee are a part, not the whole; wee include our ſelves, wee exclude not others, whether Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Armenians, Aethiopians, Spaniards or Italians, &amp;c. ſo they deny no fundamentall part of the Faith, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, or by conſequence.</p>
               <p>What Reply have you made to this? have you unfolded your meaning? have you expounded this dark phraſe? have you as much as proved, or diſproved my diſtinction, or told the Reader in which ſenſe you took it? are you ſuch a friend to amphibologies, doubtfull phraſes, and aequivocating termes, that being requeſted to open your ſelfe, you will not explaine your words, your Propoſitions and grounds, or Principles to inferre other concluſions? Such obſcure phraſes of double ſignification can make no Argument, but a fallacie which ſeemeth to be an Argument, but is none. They cannot be Propoſitions, which will not admit of one ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous terme, one ambiguous ſimple word. The onely way to avoid this, is by diſtinction. This diſtinction I brought, which you cannot deny; The thing it ſelfe is ſo cleare, that there is difference betweene a part, and the whole, betweene a part of a Citie, and a whole Citie; betweene a part of a Kingdome, and a whole Kingdome; betweene a part of the Church, and the whole Church. Hee that ſaith, I am a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>London,</hi> being made free, wrongs no man; but hee that ſayes, I am the onely Citizen, and there is no other, ſpeakes falſly, and wrongs all other Citizens of that ſociety. He that ſayes <hi>Middleſex</hi> is a part of the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ſpeakes truly, and wrongs no man; but hee that ſayes <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> is the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as if there were no other Shiere nor Province belonging unto <hi>England,</hi> ſpeakes falſly, and is no leſſe then a Traitor to the King. And hee that ſayes the Proteſtants are a Church, ſpeaks truly, and wrongs no man, becauſe hee excludes no other Chriſtian Church; but hee that ſayes the Proteſtants are the Church, as you ſay of the Romane, excluding all others, ſpeakes falſly, and wrongs all other Chriſtian Churches of the world, as the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16580:53"/>

                  </note> folly and madneſſe, they believe that Chriſt is loſt in all other parts of the world. This you ſpake of your ſelves, becauſe he that telleth a lye, ſpeaketh of himſelfe. You dare ſay with the Donatiſts, We alone are the Church; yet Chriſt did not ſay, <hi>Rome</hi> is the field, but the World is the field: that ſeed of the Goſpel was ſowne through the World, wee dare not therefore ſay as you doe, We are the Church, we are the onely Chriſtians; for this were a lye, folly and madneſſe, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> termeth it. And yet, as if there were no difference, you can paſſe this over with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (The true Church, or a true Church, as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> had rather ſay) I had rather ſay ſo indeed, becauſe this is true, the other which you ſay is falſe; this is humilitie, that is pride; this is charitable, that's uncharitable as the devill; this is injurious unto none, that to thouſands of thouſands, millions of millions, ſhutting them out of Heaven who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, are baptized into Chriſt, and ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I obſerved many needleſſe words in your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, writing thus: I muſt deſire the Authors not to affect obſcuritie, nor to alter their words, which may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their meaning, as in the fourth and fifth Propoſitions they have with the multitude of needleſſe words obſcured the matter, the fourth being briefly and plainly this: If the Proteſtants be a true Church, their Faith hath beene taught in all Ages by lawfull Paſtors, This I granted, and no more; this is your firſt falſification, as if I granted that which I expreſly deny. I deny that wee are the Chriſtian Church, which your Propoſitions layes downe, as if it were our Tenet, and this muſt be our ground to inferre that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; this is your <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> you beg a Principle which I will not grant you, and ſo the building fals for want of a foundation. Your Argument is thus:

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:16580:53"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Major.</hi> If Proteſtants be the true viſible Church of God, then all ſorts of men, who in every Age had the foreſaid infallible Faith, have learned it by hearing Proteſtant Preachers, whoſe names may yet be found in Hiſtories, as the names of thoſe are found, who in every former Age did teach and convert the people of ſeverall Nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Minor.</hi> But the Proteſtants are the true Church.</p>
                     <p>

               <p>Whatſoever is in your Propoſition more then what I expreſſed for the ſumme thereof, I granted not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have committed ſo many falſifications, as there are words in your Propoſition more then this (If the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants be a true Church, their Faith hath beene taught in all Ages by lawfull Paſtors:) I never granted that all ſorts of men in every Age did learne their Faith by hearing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Preachers, I never granted that their names, or the names of all other Preachers were to be found in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: yet you ſay, I granted all this: Is there no truth, no modeſtie, no meane, no meaſure of falſifying? Are you not aſhamed to write, that a man granted that which hee denied ſo fully, ſo frequently?</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Onely it may be hee will make a bogge at the word Hiſtories, as not finding it in his Copie, not thinking it, perhaps, neceſſary that the names of Proteſtant Paſtors, who have taught the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Faith in all Ages paſt, be found in Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>What you meane by Bogge I know not, unleſſe it be a hollow myrie ground, whereon a man can ſet no ſure, no

                  </note> neither humane reaſon, nor authoritie of holy Fathers are proper unto Divinitie, or doe properly demonſtrate. But you that ſhun the proving of your Church, of your Faith by other courſe, and flye onely to Hiſtories, you make the bogge, and ſuch a bogge whereon you dare not walke, without you fill it up with the rubbiſh of ſome other kind of Records, or Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>If you meane by making a bogge at the word Hiſtories, that I ſhould be afraid to admit the ſame now, becauſe it was not in my former Copy; you are deceived, I feare it not, let it come in, though with a Parentheſis, and let Hiſtories extend to Records, or Monuments, ſo they be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, I well receive them in their degree as a humane, probable, uncertaine, unneceſſitating proofe, and yet ſuch, and ſo uncertaine proofe as it is, if you can ſhew mee your now Faith out of Hiſtories for the firſt foure hundred years, which you your ſelves doe not accuſe of errour, falſhood, wilfull deceit, juggling, partialitie, hereſie, I will be of your Faith, of your Church.</p>

               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I have admitted your extenſion of Hiſtories to Records and Monuments.</p>

the fourth Propoſition, even as it was ſet downe by Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Within twelve lines before, you ſay (<hi>Neither doth Maſter</hi> Rogers <hi>make any bones to grant</hi>) and here now you ſay (<hi>I doe not ſee why Maſter</hi> Rogers <hi>may not abſolutely grant it</hi>) there you ſay I did grant it, here you ſuppoſe I did not grant it. You ſee no reaſon why I ſhould not grant. If it be evident, it hath reaſon why it is evident; and being your Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you muſt ſhew that reaſon, and what your reaſons are, and how propoſed, let us ſee.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>For if any viſible Proteſtant Paſtors were in all ages, teaching eſpecially any ſuch Proteſtant Doctrines as now are taught, they would have beene named, and ſpoken of, and written of, as well as others are, who have in Ages paſt taught all ſorts of true and falſe Doctrines.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Firſt you play the Sophiſter, in changing your termes: in your three firſt Propoſitions you ſpeake of Faith, here you leave out Faith, and put in Doctrines, as if they were the ſame; whereas you know that the ancient Fathers, and late Writers of your ſide and ours doe confeſſe, that there are many Doctrines in the Church of different nature and neceſſitie; but let us ſee your proofe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Others, who have in all Ages paſt taught all ſorts of true and falſe Doctrines, are named, ſpoken of, and written in Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>

               <p>Firſt, tell mee whether your Antecedent be univerſall or particular; if particular, you conclude nothing: you know the old rule, <hi>Syllogizari non eſt ex particulari;</hi> or if you will have it in the words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the rule is this,<note place="margin">Ariſt. lib.

                  </note> If both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be indefinite, or in part, it can be no Syllogiſme; and ſuch is yours, namely, an indefinite Propoſition, which

muſt be reſolved either into univerſall, or particular. If yours be univerſall, thus:</p>
               <p>All others, who have in all Ages paſt taught all ſorts of true and falſe Doctrines, are named in Hiſtories, I denie it. It is related by many Hiſtorians, that there were Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Britaine</hi> in the third, fourth and fifth Age. But no man hath put downe all their names, who were their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or inferior Miniſters: if you can doe it, ſhew it mee. Againe, the Arrians were ſo many in the fourth Age, as that a Father ſaith, <hi>Miratus eſt mundus ſe ſubitò factum eſſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianum,</hi> The world wondered how it came on a ſudden to be of the Faith of <hi>Arrius.</hi> And can you, Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> ſhew mee the names of theſe Arrian Teachers? I could be copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in alleaging divers falſe Doctrines, whoſe firſt Authors are not named, are not knowne, much leſſe all that taught the ſame; ſo that if your Propoſition be univerſall, it is falſe: I denie your Antecedent. If particular, thus; Some others, who taught all ſorts of true and falſe Doctrines, are named in Hiſtories. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ie your Argument, and as well I might ſay,
<q>
                     <p>Some men have no Noſes,</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> is ſome man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> As you inferre any concluſion out of your particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>In regard there cannot be aſſigned any reaſon either of the part of Gods providence, or humane diligence, why the names of others, even falſe Teachers, in all Ages, ſhould be ſet downe and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Hiſtories yet extant, rather then the names of ſuch, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants deeme to be the onely true Teachers of pure Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Yet you are in your indefinite ſaying <hi>(others, even falſe Teachers)</hi> you will neither adde all nor ſome, to make it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall, thus; The providence of God, and diligence of man hath preſerved the names of all falſe Teachers in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For then the falſhood would be cleare: neither have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16580:55"/>
you made it particular, thus; The providence of God, and diligence of men have preſerved the names of ſome falſe Teachers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> of Proteſtant Teachers: for then it would appeare that this were a <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> that particulars can inferre no concluſion.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>For doubtleſſe, both God, who is zealous of his honour, and carefull to honour and preſerve the memorie of them that would honour him, would for his honour ſake have procured honourable memorie of ſuch, as did by teaching truth honour him.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Their names muſt be found in Hiſtories, <hi>Negatur Argumentum.</hi> Is this the honour? Is this the glorie that God hath provided for his children, to be recorded by man? It is written as you have cited in your Margin,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall glorifie mee, I will glorifie him; and whoſoever ſhall contemne mee, ſhall be ignoble.</hi> Who ever expounded this place of Scripture to be meant of humane teſtimonies, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recorded in humane Hiſtories, and not of that honour which is uſually termed the ſtate of glorie?</p>
               <p>The other place cited in your Margin, is, <hi>The just ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance: Ergo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.7.</note> Their names ſhall be recorded in humane Hiſtories. Who ever made ſuch colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? God hath promiſed eternall glorie unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and you will turne it to temporall: for what is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane teſtimonie, and humane glorie, but temporall? which ſhall end either before, or at leaſt with time.</p>
               <p>O preſumptuous blindneſſe of man! to accuſe the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God as defective, if it record not all their names in humane Hiſtorie, whoſe names are written in the Booke of Life. I am loath to ſpend many words in anſwering ſuch poore objections, but the impietie, prophaneneſſe, Atheiſme that is implied in this Argument, opens my mouth to ſpeak ſomewhat more. Whereas you ſay, If God will glorifie his ſervants, hee muſt record them in humane Hiſtories: this muſt imply, that God hath no other way to glorifie his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as that there were no reſurrection of the fleſh, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16580:56"/>
of the ſoule, no Book of Life, no Heaven, no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in another world.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>And men carefull of their ſoules health, which they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (according to the ordinary courſe) but by hearing ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors onely who have had lawfull ſucceſſion from Chriſts Apoſtles, have more reaſon diligently to looke that memorie be preſerved of ſuch Paſtors, and of pure divine Truth taught by them, then of others who taught any other falſe, and not pure Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Here are two trickes of a Sophiſter, the one to obſcure a Propoſition with a multitude of needleſſe and impertinent words; for ſeeing hee was to prove this plaine and ſhort Propoſition, That the names of Paſtors teaching divine Truth, are to be found in Hiſtories: and that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> whereby hee would prove this, hee tooke from the diligence and dutie of Godly men, what needs all thoſe additions which come in by Parentheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> (which they cannot attaine according to the ordinarie courſe) but by hearing ſuch Paſtors onely, who have had lawfull ſucceſſion from Chriſts Apoſtles. The ſecond tricke of a Sophiſter, is to ſpeake indefinitely, and ſo making it doubtfull, whether your Propoſition be univerſall or particular, not joyning either all or ſome unto others, as I have obſerved before. Your Argument which I muſt frame for you (or I am like to have none) is this:</p>
               <p>Men carefull of their ſoules health, have reaſon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the memorie of their Paſtors: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They did ſo. Or to make it more large, thus:</p>
               <p>Men carefull of their ſoules health, have more reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to looke that memory be preſerved of ſuch Paſtors, and of pure divine Truth taught by them, then of others, who have taught any other falſe, and not pure Doctrine. But they continued the memorie of the falſe Teachers. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> They continued the memorie of the true Teachers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you conclude not what you were to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16580:56"/>
the names of all true Teachers in all ages are to bee found in Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for your <hi>minor,</hi> if it be univerſall, it is falſe; if it be particular, it doth not inferre, it doth prove nothing, as I have already ſhewed more fully.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, your Argument hath foure termes; in the <hi>major,</hi> your <hi>medium</hi> is the duty of men what they ought to doe; In the <hi>minor</hi> you ſpeake of what they did, and ſuppoſe a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>viz.</hi> that men carefull of their ſoules health have recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the names of all falſe Teachers, and ſo you would inferre they did record the names of all true Teachers; and thus to prove the act from the duty in weake ſinfull man, is no proofe, is like the reſt, an egregious <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> And as well I might argue thus, Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> ought to have replied punctually in order, and alleadging my words in my anſwer to him: <hi>ergo,</hi> he did it. Or thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould have abſtained from the forbidden fruit: <hi>ergo,</hi> ſhe did abſtaine from it. Or thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had more reaſon to hearken unto God, forbidding him to eate of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evill, then to his wife perſwading him to eate thereof: <hi>ergo,</hi> he did not hearken unto his wife. Or thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> had more reaſon to defend his Maſter, then to betray him: <hi>ergo,</hi> he did not betray him. Or thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> had more reaſon to confeſſe his Maſter, then to deny him: <hi>ergo, Peter</hi> did not deny his Maſter.</p>
               <p>If this kind of arguing were good, it were happy for us all in the day of Iudgement, when the Idolater ſhould ſay, I had more reaſon to worſhip God, then to worſhip Idols: <hi>ergo,</hi> I did not worſhip Idols.</p>
               <p>The murtherer would ſay, I had more reaſon to ſave, then to kill: <hi>ergo,</hi> I did not kill. The drunkard would ſay, I had more reaſon to be ſober then to be drunke: <hi>ergo,</hi> I was not drunke. And ſo might all other ſinners plead, if this argument were good.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Certaine therefore it is, that the names (or ſome thing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16580:57"/>
equivalent to names) and the doctrines of true Paſtors, who did in all ages paſt teach true divine doctrine, may be found in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as well as the names, and doctrines of others are found, who did teach any other doctrine.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed it to be moſt uncertaine, that as well you might conclude, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not betray Chriſt, or <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>And therefore if Proteſtants have had any Paſtors teaching true doctrines in all ages, doubtleſſe their names would be extant in Hiſtories yet extant.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewed your Antecedent to be falſe, if uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall; not to prove, if particular; and ſo this concluſion, if particular I grant, if univerſall I deny; and ſay, that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall concluſion cannot follow out of particular premiſes. You know the unqueſtioned rule, <hi>Concluſio ſequitur deterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem partem.</hi>

               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I neither ſuppoſed nor granted it: what I granted in the fourth Propoſition was this, and no more; If the Proteſtants be a true Church, their faith hath beene taught in all ages by lawfull Paſtors. What mention is there here of Names, of Hiſtories, of Records, of Monuments? let the Reader looke
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16580:57"/>
backe to my former anſwer, and he ſhall find that this is all the iſſue I joyned upon in the fourth Propoſition. This is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity Maſter <hi>Fiſher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>For it being ſuppoſed that Proteſtant Preachers were, their names would be found in Hiſtories, (as Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth propoſition granted by Master <hi>Rogers</hi> ſuppoſeth) it may be well inferred, that if no ſuch mens names be found in Histories, then no ſuch men were in all ages, nor conſequently are Proteſtants the true Church of Chriſt, for it hath had ſuch in all ages: I doe not therefore ſee, I ſay, how Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> can deny Master <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers</hi> fifth propoſition, ſuppoſing he grant, as he granteth his fourth propoſition.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>You ſay that I ſuppoſing, and granting your fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I muſt yeeld unto the fifth; I have replyed more then once, your fourth Propoſition, eſpecially that which you moſt inſiſt upon therein, names and Hiſtories I deny, and this not being granted, your fifth Propoſition cannot follow.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>For although, abſolutely ſpeaking, an Argument drawne from negative authority, be (as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> averreth) of it ſelfe of no force: and ſo Proteſtant Arguments which are uſually made againſt us out of negative authority; as for example, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith nothing of this or that; or the Fathers of the firſt <hi>300.</hi> yeeres make no expreſſe mention of this or that: <hi>ergo,</hi> no ſuch thing is, or is of no force.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of our diſcourſe was humane Hiſtory, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority, and what I ſpeake you grant; but you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it beyond the boundes of our then ſubject, and more then I will grant, to Divine authority, to the word of God, to the Scriptures: I ſay the authority of man is like himſelfe, uncertaine; his workes weake, and unperfect like himſelfe;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16580:58"/>
but the word of God is like himſelfe, certaine, ſtrong and full of perfection, and therefore the Argument drawne from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, is certaine, though negatively, in thoſe things which the word of God propoſeth, and profeſſeth fully to expreſſe; but in man it is otherwiſe, as in the next Chapter I will expreſſe more fully.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Yet when the negative Argument is grounded in an alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die granted affirmative propoſition, as it is in this our caſe, the negative argument is of great, and undeniable force.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>This I grant, that negatives are ſo farre depending upon affirmatives, as that they cannot be underſtood, they cannot be defined, they cannot be demonſtrated without affirmatives: and ſo, they may.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>As for example, if we did grant this propoſition; If ſuch or ſuch a thing were, holy Scripture would have ſpoken of it, or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the firſt <hi>300</hi> yeeres would have made expreſſe mention of it. If I ſay we granted this, we could not deny the aforeſaid negative Argument, uſually made by Proteſtants to be of force againſt us.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I doe not ſee what I ſhould miſlike in this, onely it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing againſt me.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>But wee deny, and Proteſtants cannot prove the ſaid affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, and ſo the negative Argument hath no force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>You deny, but wee have proved the affirmative, that all things neceſſary unto ſalvation are plainely ſet downe in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16580:58"/>
Scripture, and therefore the negative Argument is of force againſt your new Creed, the Articles whereof are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in Scripture, as I have more fully ſet downe in the fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Now Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth not, nor in reaſon cannot deny Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth propoſition, which is an affirmative, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fifth negative propoſition is grounded; And therefore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ought not to deny, but muſt needs grant Maſters <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers</hi> fifth, and ſo all his five propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cuckoe,</hi> a Bird that makes no good muſick, and hath but one note, yet is more frequent in venting that, then the <hi>Nightingale</hi> in tuning her excellent Muſicke. Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> having nothing elſe to ſay in defence of his Church, and againſt ours; cries for Names, and Hiſtories; and not being able to prove his propoſition, ſtill ſings the ſame ſong: Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth not, nor in reaſon cannot deny, ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but muſt needs grant: which being preſuppoſed, and granted, as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ſeemeth to grant, by granting I doe not ſee how Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> can deny; I doe not therefore ſee, I ſay, how Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> can deny Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fifth Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuppoſing he granted, as he granteth his fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, neither doth Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> make any bones to grant; I doe not ſee why M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers</hi> may not abſolutely grant his fourth Propoſition; all theſe grants are found in one leafe, and halfe a page, and yet I never granted it.</p>

                  <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> a begging of that which is in queſtion; I have oft enough denyed it, yet you will never leave begging it; belike you thinke to wreſt it from me with importunacie: it will never be, I pray you looke backe, ſee what I anſwered to your fifth Propoſition, there you ſhall reade thus.</p>
               <p>In the fifth Propoſition, I deſire to know whether wee ſhould ſhew the names of Proteſtants, or their faith. This we will ſhew, That we need not, for the names of Proteſtants is but arbitrary, and accidentall, &amp;c. And within a few lines after, you ſhall reade thus. But if it be really meant thus; let the Proteſtants ſhew that their now faith was taught by lawfull Paſtors in all ages: I doe (with Gods helpe) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and require the ſame from the authors of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and demands.</p>
               <p>Have I here granted that the names of all Paſtors, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers true or falſe are to be found in Hiſtories, which is the onely ground whence you would inferre your fifth Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being not granted by me, I needed not to have ſet downe names of Proteſtant Paſtors in all ages, or in any age: My two firſt Arguments, the one, <hi>a cauſis,</hi> the other, <hi>a ſignis,</hi> might have ſerved the turne, without the third, <hi>ab exemplis;</hi> and I might have contented my ſelfe with going leſſe then halfe that way, which is your way, and not mine; I never tooke it for other then an uncertaine, darke, ſlippery, cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome way; it was your only way, and yet you would not goe one ſtep.</p>
               <p>Did ever any Iudge citing a man by writ to appeare before him at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> limit him which way he ſhould come? would you thinke it reaſon that a Iudge ſhould command a <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> man to come to <hi>London,</hi> not through <hi>Worceſter</hi> or <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but through <hi>Shropſhire, Darbyſhire, Yorke, &amp;c.</hi> The two Evangeliſts, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> deriving the pedigree of our Saviour from <hi>David,</hi> yet did it by different wayes,<note place="margin">De Doct.

My journey is to Chriſt, my ſcope to

Yet even in this your owne way I doubt not but I ſhall goe as farre as you in a day, and ſhall come ſooner to my journeyes end then you ſhall, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which now I will alleadge in the ſucceeding Chapter.</p>

give others ſatisfaction, I will enlarge theſe foure reaſons in this Chapter; not that your objections require any ſuch full anſwer in this point; that I have performed already. Firſt, of the uncertainty of humane Hiſtories, <hi>Bodin</hi> in that learned diſcourſe of his, entitled; <hi>The Method of Hiſtories,</hi> a man of your owne, who alſo dedicated that booke unto the chiefe Preſident of your Court of Inquiſition, doth make foure kindes of Hiſtories. Firſt, Humane; Secondly, Naturall; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mathematicall; Fourthly, Divine. The firſt he ſaies is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and confuſed; the ſecond for the moſt part certaine; the third more certaine; the fourth moſt certaine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Yet you Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> in this divine queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the fourth which is divine, moſt certaine, and immutable, and will have no other proofe then the firſt, which is humane, uncertaine and confuſed. When <hi>Ticonius</hi> in the ſame queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did alleadge <hi>Divini Teſtamenti tonitrua,</hi> thoſe thundering

If <hi>Parmenianus</hi> were not in love with his Epiſcopall Chaire, he would rather chooſe to beleeve the written word of God, then his fellow Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Thus much, and much more to this purpoſe in that Booke, and divers other Bookes of the ſeventh Tome: but I will conclude this of the uncertainty of humane teſtimony, with the words of that Father in his ſecond Tome, in his 48. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Neceſſe eſt incerti ſint qui pro ſua ſocietate, teſtimonio utuntur non Divino ſed ſuo.</hi> It is of neceſſity that they muſt be uncertaine, who defend their ſociety not by the teſtimony of God, but by their owne.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the uncertainty in it ſelfe, but much more uncertaine is all that you ſhall alleadge, ſince you have by your <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> altered Authors, to your purpoſe, at your pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Pope himſelfe and the Ordinaries, in their ſeverall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, as alſo the Officers of Inquiſition againſt Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes are carefull to prevent the publiſhing of any Bookes, which may ſeeme any way to derogate from the power of the Pope;<note place="margin">Widring. in Apol. pro jure princ. pag. <hi>343.</hi>

with authoritie and power over all the world, more then that of the Empire is, and that hee be honoured and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped more then the Emperour.

The other forgerie was diſcovered by a Councell of <hi>Africke,</hi> conſiſting of 217 Biſhops, whereof Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was one, who wrote to the Pope thus; Touching that you wrote unto us concerning the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, in the very true Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> which wee have received from the happy Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wee find no ſuch matter. <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſecond was ſo much moved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, above an hundred yeares after, as to ſay,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalium.</note> That all theſe Biſhops (whereof Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was one) were all infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and led by the Devill.

               <p>The Haereſie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> the greateſt that ever was in the Church; the labours, troubles and conſtancie of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt this Haereſie of greateſt note, and moſt glorious of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Confeſſor that ever the Chriſtian Church had before or ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sozomen</hi> lived in the fitteſt Age to be informed of theſe things, in the fitteſt Church, namely in the Greeke Church, where theſe things were done; and yet is he ſo full of errors in matters of greateſt moment, on which the eyes of all the Chriſtians in the world ſtood at a gaze? Is hee ſo full of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in theſe things which were ſo cleare as the Sun in the firmament, ſo many Records being preſerved of thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo many Letters paſſing from one Biſhop to another? muſt wee thinke that <hi>Baronius,</hi> who lived 1200 yeares after, and no member, no Inhabitant of the Greeke Church knew theſe things better then <hi>Sozomen</hi> did, and kicke him off, with ſaying, Hee was an impudent fellow? <hi>an.</hi> 324. <hi>n.</hi> 19.

Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> to whom wee may adde <hi>Theodoret,</hi> all three began their Hiſtorie where <hi>Euſebius</hi> ended, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the ſame unto the raigne of <hi>Theodoſius junior,</hi> which was about the yeare 400.

and of the Greeke Church, to whom if wee adde the ſhort Hiſtorie of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who was a Presbyter of the Latine Church, wee have all the profeſſed Hiſtorians of note that I have ſeene and read for thoſe times; ſo that if the authoritie of theſe men be ſlighted, and excepted againſt as erroneous, falſe, impudent, lying Haereticks, I know not what Hiſtories Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> will produce for the chiefeſt time of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, the firſt 400 yeares.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Vthoritie; as for example, the Scripture ſaith nothing of this or that, or the Fathers of the first three hundred yeares make no expreſſe mention of this or that: <hi>Ergo,</hi> No ſuch thing is, or is of no force. Yet when the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument is grounded in an already granted Affirmative Propoſition, as it is in this our caſe, the Negative Argument is of great and undeniable force.</p>
               <p>As for example, if wee did grant this Propoſition; if ſuch, or ſuch a thing were, holy Scripture would have ſpoken of it, or the Fathers of the first three hundred yeares would have made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe mention of it. If, I ſay, wee granted this, wee could not deny the aforeſaid Negative Argument, uſually made by Proteſtants, to be of force againſt us.</p>
               <p>Now Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth not, nor in reaſon cannot deny Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fourth Propoſition, which is an Affirmative where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his fifth Negative Propoſition, is grounded. And therefore Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> ought not to deny, but muſt needs grant Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> fifth, and ſo all his five Propoſitions. Which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if hee will make a good anſwer, as hee pretendeth, hee muſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16580:64"/>
first ſet downe names of Proteſtant Paſtors in all Ages, and not content himſelfe with naming ſome whom he thinketh to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and with ſaying hee hath gone halfe the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If hee will ſatisfie Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> other Paper, as he pretendeth to doe, hee muſt prove, and defend them to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> Paper requireth; and muſt bring ſome or other good Authors, who doe clearly ſhew them to hold all, or ſome principall points of Proteſtants Faith, differing from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Roman Faith; and not to condemne any of the <hi>39</hi> Proteſtant Articles; and muſt not content himſelfe with making ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as hee maketh, which are moſt inſufficient either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or probably to perſwade, either his Adverſary, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different judicious Reader; for theſe be his Arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>a Cauſis</hi> thus.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>a Signis</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>The faith is that which hath teſtimonies of Antiquities, univerſality and conſent of fathers, and other writers in all ages.</p>

               <p>Thus having gone halfe way I conclude with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Proteſtant faith being that which is contained in Scriptures, was received and taught by all the Orthodox Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:16580:65"/>
                  <hi>But the Fathers above named be all Orthodox:</hi> ergo.</p>
               <p>Now who doth not ſee that theſe Arguments be moſt inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and that they may be moſt eaſily anſwered, by denying the Proteſtant faith to be contained in Scriptures, or to have teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of antiquity, univerſality, and conſent; or to have beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by thoſe Fathers which Master <hi>Rogers</hi> named. Who doth not alſo ſee that the ſame Arguments may be more ſtrongly retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against Proteſtants, by only altering the word Proteſtant into Catholick? in regard our Catholick doctrine may be, and is ordinarily proved by plaine Teſtimonies of Scriptures, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even by confeſſion of divers learned Proteſtants themſelves. I marvaile therefore, that M. <hi>Rogers</hi> being accounted a worthy <hi>Oxford</hi> Divine, would affirme and offer to prove, and defend Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to have beene in all ages upon ſo ſleight grounds; which if they be admitted for good, every ſect of Hereticks may affirme, and prove, and defend men of their ſect to have beene in all ages. For tryall whereof, I wiſh it may be imagined that there were an Anabaptiſt, (for example) who held all the Proteſtant faith ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely ſome few negatives; and namely, that it is not lawfull to baptize Infants: and that this Anabaptiſt had framed to himſelfe ſuch falſe Rules, as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> hath ſet downe to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I deſire Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and the Reader to looke backe to the former page of the precedent leafe, to which I have already anſwered; for in matter it was the ſame with that which went before, contained in the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. pages of Maſter <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers</hi> Booke, againſt me, which were all ſpent in ſeeking to ſtrengthen his owne Propoſitions, his owne grounds, yet the Title he gave unto both thoſe Pages was, <hi>Maſter</hi> Rogers <hi>his moſt weake grounds,</hi> there being in both thoſe Pages not one ſentence, nor line, nor word concerning any grounds of mine: ſo in the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page of his Booke he hath put this Title.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> his moſt weake Arguments.</p>
               <p>Whereas there is not one Argument, nor one Propoſition of mine in all that Page, as may eaſily appeare to him that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16580:65"/>
will but reade the ſame; onely he ſpeaketh ſomething in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his owne grounds to which I have already anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yet becauſe of the Title, agreeing with the 29 and 30 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which follow next after, I have copied them out, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them altogether that have this title, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> his moſt weake Arguments.</p>
               <p>Which I thinke he did to gull his Proſelytes, who reading but the Title muſt thinke that Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> hath ſhewed my grounds and Arguments to be weake, when, and where, hee hath not made any mention of any Arguments of mine.</p>

               <p>1. Arg. Firſt, <hi>a Cauſis</hi> thus.</p>
               <p>The Faith contained in the Scriptures, hath had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
               <p>But the Proteſtant Faith is contained in the Scriptures. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Proteſtant Faith had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>

Neither is hee ignorant, that in this Controverſie of the viſible Church, betweene them and us, It is not the inward habit, but the outward profeſſion of Faith which maketh a viſible Church. <hi>Eccleſia conſtat profeſſione ejuſde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fidei,</hi>

doth teſtifie the ſame; for they are admitted into the Church who profeſſe the Faith.

If but one man ſhould come into the face of a congregation, and ſay, I doe profeſſe, and believe onely thoſe things which are contained in Scriptures: were not hee very impudent, and had a face harder then braſſe, who would ſay to this man, Thou doſt not profeſſe that Faith which is contained in Scriptures.

               <p>Wee profeſſe no Articles of Faith, but thoſe which are contained in the Apoſtles Creed; which of theſe Articles are not contained in Scriptures? <hi>Ad Partes,</hi> Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> this is the law of anſwering to a Propoſition that hath many members; wee profeſſe that with a religious divine Faith, wee receive nothing but what is contained in the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Ioſhua, Iudges, Ruth,</hi> the two books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the two books of <hi>Kings,</hi> the two books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the two books of <hi>Eſdras, Eſther,</hi> the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> or the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or <hi>Proverbs,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> or the <hi>Canticles,</hi> or the foure greater, or twelve leſſer Prophets; Or in the foure Evangeliſts, or in the Acts of the Apoſtles, or the Revelation and Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Iude:</hi> which of theſe bookes is not Scripture?

               <p>2. Arg. <hi>A Signis</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>The Faith which hath teſtimonies of Antiquitie, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie, and conſent of Fathers, and other Writers in all ages, had viſible Profeſſors in all ages.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Faith of Proteſtants had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
               <p>To this you anſwer, by denying the <hi>Minor,</hi> or ſecond Propoſition thus: The Proteſtant Faith hath not teſtimonies of Antiquitie, Univerſalitie, and conſent. <hi>Ad partes,</hi> Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which Article of the Apoſtles Creed doth want the teſtimonie of Antiquitie, Univerſalitie, and conſent? which of thoſe Bookes, received for Canonical of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and named of mee a little before, want theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Antiquitie, Univerſalitie, and conſent?

               <p>Thus having gone halfe way I conclude with this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Proteſtant faith being that which is contained in Scriptures, was received and taught by all the Orthodox Fathers.</p>
               <p>But the Fathers above named be all Orthodox. <hi>Ergo:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what anſwer doe you, Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> give to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of mine? not a word, unleſſe to denie the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be to anſwer an Argument, I hope you will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your ſelfe to be ſo ignorant in Logicke, you know the Rule: <q>Ex veris poſſit nil niſi vera ſequi</q>
               </p>
               <p>If my Premiſes be true, my Argument in forme; as you neither deny my Premiſes, nor except againſt the forme of my Argument, the concluſion muſt follow, muſt be true; for out of true Premiſes can follow no concluſion, but what is true:<note place="margin">Ariſt. De Sophiſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lench. c. <hi>17, 18,</hi> &amp;c.</note> this is not eaſie anſwering, but not anſwering. Looke into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concerning the duty of a Reſpondent, and the divers kinds of anſwering. You, not being able to anſwer this Argument, ſay, I muſt bring out ſome or other good Authors, who doe clearly ſhew theſe before named, to hold all, or ſome principall points of Proteſtant Faith, differing from the Catholicke Roman Faith. I have proved what I undertooke, and what is ſufficient, by ſuch Arguments as you cannot anſwer; you dare not examine, but flye from them, knowing their ſtrength, and your weakneſſe. But you will have me prove them by Authors; is any humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a private man better then reaſon? And what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors would you have? will not their owne profeſſion, and their owne workes, together with the eſteeme and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Orthodox Writers, which they have had in all Ages, ſerve the turne to ſhew what their Faith was? doe any men know what they did believe, or what they did profeſſe, better then themſelves? As for your Roman Catholicke Faith, I have alreadie ſhewed, how fond, how vaine, how
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16580:68"/>
ſimple a conjunction you make of them; that no child ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily of ſeven yeares of age, underſtanding the termes, but will wonder with what face you can ſay, That a part of a Church is a whole Church, that a part of a Kingdome is a whole Kingdome, that a part of mans Body is the whole Body.</p>
               <p>You ſay alſo, that I muſt prove out of good Authors, that they doe not condemne any of the 39 Proteſtant Articles: Here you, not being able to anſwer (as I thinke) doe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conceale, and paſſe by what I did put downe in anſwer to this demand of yours: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. It is no prejudice to our Faith, if the ſame Authors doe differ from us in other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, not concerning Faith, as long as they maintaine our Faith. 2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot produce Fathers in all Ages, who doe not contradict the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> in ſome Doctrines eſtabliſhed in the ſaid Councell. This you can conceale, and paſſe over, knowing that you are not able to performe it, for your Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> I undertooke for matters of Faith, not for ſecondarie Doctrines, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Authors in all Ages, profeſſing our Faith, though they might diſſent from us in other Doctrines of an inferior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not revealed in Scripture, nor belonging to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Principles of Chriſtian Religion. As for the ſufficiencie of my Arguments, I have already made it good, for any thing that you have yet ſpoken againſt them. Let us now ſee what you ſay further againſt them?</p>

               <p>Concluſion: Ergo, <hi>The Catholicke Faith had viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in all Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I have onely changed the word <hi>Proteſtant</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke;</hi> and what one word is here againſt Proteſtants, who doe hold, and profeſſe no other Faith then what is contained in Scriptures? as I have already ſhewed out of our ſixt Article; wee grant this whole Argument, Major, Minor, and Concluſion: which if you doe grant, I will take the Minor, and inferre a dangerous Concluſion againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Catholicke Faith is contained in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The Roman Faith is not contained in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Roman Faith is not the Catholicke Faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p>If you denie this Minor, as it ſeemes by thoſe words of yours before alleadged, you will denie, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Catholick Doctrine may be, and is ordinarily proved by plaine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scriptures, and Fathers, even by confeſſion of learned Proteſtants themſelves.</p>
               <p>I will prove it; yet firſt let me tell you, that here you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a moſt groſſe untruth; if by <hi>Catholick</hi> you meane <hi>Roman,</hi> to ſay that divers learned Proteſtants doe confeſſe, that your Roman doctrine may be, and is ordinarily proved by plaine teſtimonies of Scriptures, and Fathers. This, I ſay, is a moſt manifeſt and groſſe untruth, ſeeing no learned Writers of our ſide doe ſay ſo much. Why doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> make Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16580:69"/>
a part of the Rule, not the whole Rule, but to bring in unwritten Traditions? writing a whole Booke <hi>de verbo Dei non ſcripto,</hi> of the unwritten Word of God.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Valenza</hi> in his fourth Tome upon <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> is very full in ſeeking to prove the ſame in his firſt diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>de objecto fidei,</hi> delivering theſe Propoſitions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the authoritie to judge in matters of Faith is not contained onely in Scripture, <hi>Diſputatione prima, puncto ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo, quaeſtione tertia, Sect.</hi> 4.

               <p>Is this your eaſie anſwering, Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> to grant your Adverſarie that which hee moſt deſireth; to diſſent from your Councell of <hi>Trent?</hi> would you but adde this to what you have written, which followes neceſſarily, I will not ſubſcribe to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I will not be led by <hi>Valenza,</hi> herein I will leave the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> I will hold no Doctrine which is not proved by plaine teſtimonie of Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flying unto unwritten Traditions; I would rejoyce to ſee you a Proteſtant in the maine ground-worke, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all our Religion, hoping, that if you continue in this mind, you will ſhortly agree in the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee how the ſecond Argument may be retorted
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16580:70"/>
againſt the Proteſtants, by onely changing the word <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> into <hi>Catholicke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Arg. <hi>A Signis,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Faith which hath teſtimonies of Antiquitie, Vniverſalitie, and conſent of Fathers, and other Writers in all Ages, had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
                  <p>But the Faith of Catholickes had theſe teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Faith of Catholickes had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
               </q>
               <p>What one word is here againſt Proteſtants? wee grant both the Premiſes and Concluſion, ſo doe not you. For they be your owne words within a few lines, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome points were at firſt, not held neceſſarie to be believed, even by Orthodox Fathers, which after by examination, and definition of the Church, in Generall Councels, were made ſo neceſſarie to be believed, as that whoſoever did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them were accounted not Orthodox, but Haereticks.</p>
               <p>Theſe are your owne words; from whence it doth follow, that many neceſſarie points were denied in precedent Ages by Orthodox Fathers; and thence it muſt follow againe, that they wanted the teſtimonie of all Ages, being denied in ſome Ages by the Orthodox Fathers. Such teſtimonies the Articles of your Roman Faith may have, yet Orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers denie them: and therefore, to frame the Arguments againe, not according to your words, which I have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by changing <hi>Proteſtant</hi> into <hi>Catholicke,</hi> but into Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for that I thinke you underſtand by Catholicke. Let it be thus:
<q>
                     <p>The Faith contained in the Scriptures had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
                     <p>But the Roman Faith is contained in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Roman Faith had viſible Profeſſors in all Ages.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Would to God your Minor were true, I would be glad to meet with you in the Concluſion. But I have already ſhewed out of your owne Writers, and Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that you hold the contrary; and your new Creed being
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16580:70"/>
examined by Scripture, will finde more contradiction there then proofe; unwritten traditions equalled to the word of God; Seven Sacraments improperly ſo called; halfe Communion; Tranſubſtantiation; Invocation of Saints; worſhipping of Images have neither teſtimony of Scriptures nor Fathers; this you know well enough, and therefore you could paſſe over a great deale of my Reply without any mention of what I had replied: My words were theſe; Having gone thus farre at this time, I undertake for the reſt, and doe require the like from the Romaniſts, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they would ſhew me the names of ſuch as taught the now faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all ages, and let them ſet me downe the names as I have done.</p>
               <p>And for inſtances in points of Roman faith in all ages, I require theſe men to ſhew me the names of thoſe who in the firſt, ſecond, third Centurie of yeares, did preach, or profeſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions to be the rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the vulgar Latine tranſlation is authenticall. Thirdly, that there are ſeven Sacraments, improperly ſo called, and no more. Fourthly, that the bookes of <hi>Machabees</hi> are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall. Fiftly, Tranſubſtantiation. Sixtly, Invocation of Saints. Seventhly, worſhipping of Images, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This rule (of ſhewing the names of ſuch as profeſſed the faith in all ages) is propoſed by them, which though it be no neceſſary conſequence of faith, yet it bindeth them that propoſe it to make it good in particular.</p>
               <p>Out of their owne Poſition thus I argue.</p>
               <p>Firſt Argument.</p>
               <p>That is a true Church whoſe faith hath had viſible profeſſors in all ages, whoſe names may be ſhewed out of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to be ſuch.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh faith had not ſuch viſible profeſſors in all ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Roman is not a true Church.</p>
               <p>Second Argument.</p>
               <p>The true faith hath the teſtimonies of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalitie, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and Conſent.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:16580:71"/>But the Romiſh faith (as farre as they differ from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants faith, which they doe in all the points above alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, hath not teſtimonies of Vniverſalitie, Antiquitie, and Conſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Romiſh faith in thoſe points wherein they differ from the Proteſtants faith, is not a true faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Let the Romaniſts anſwer theſe two Arguments in thoſe particular points above written, and I will be of their Church.</p>
               <p>Thus much in my former anſwer, to which you have made no replie at all, you have neither given any inſtance which point of my faith is not contained in Scriptures, or wanteth the teſtimony of Vniverſalitie, Antiquitie, and Conſent, or was not beleeved, and profeſſed by thoſe Fathers by me alledged.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you have not anſwered to thoſe inſtances of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faith, though I required it but for three ages, nor to the Arguments which I made againſt you, though this were a rule of your owne, to ſhew names in all ages, and denied by me to be a neceſſary conſequence of faith; onely this you ſay, firſt, that my grounds are ſlight, and may fit all ſorts of Hereticks, and you inſtance in the Anabaptiſts. Secondly, you ſay my grounds are falſe, to both which I will reply whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I have made out my Catalogue for the other ſucceeding ages before <hi>Luther.</hi>

Which I aſſure my ſelfe they cannot doe, and I doe verily perſwade my ſelfe never meane to attempt; onely becauſe they would ſay ſome thing, they will lay a falſe ground, and require their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to build upon thoſe Sands, which when we have done, they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16580:71"/>
will never proceed to doe as much for their faith; but cavill at others, and never ſpeake any thing in defence of their owne faith; being aſſured in their conſciences that it is impoſſible they ſhould be able to performe it. Firſt, for the novelty of thoſe points of faith acknowledged by ſome of themſelves. Secondly, for the want of learning and good Authours in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſucceeding ages. For to ſpeake a little of the firſt, what Authors can they finde for their halfe Communion in the firſt ages, ſeeing it is confeſſed by moſt of them that ever I heard, or read, that the contrary was practiſed for a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt? This much was acknowledged by one, who (as I have been ſince informed) was a Ieſuite, in the preſence and hearing of Sir <hi>Sa. A.</hi> of his Lady, Maſter <hi>Weſtph.</hi> and others. And your moſt induſtrious quoter Maſter <hi>Briere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> can finde no Author for it before the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which was 1400 yeeres after the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh; unleſſe he relie upon the Haereticks, the Maniches. What Authors will they finde in the firſt ages for worſhipping of Images, for Purgatory, for Invocation of Saints, for Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c? as I have before mentioned. If they be able to deſcend but three ages from Chriſt, and produce good Authors which did beleeve theſe, and make them matters of faith, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now doth, I will be of their Church, I will leave the Church of <hi>England;</hi> nay, I will leave (which I will not doe for a thouſand Empires) my hope of heaven. This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of theirs I know to be ſo vaine, falſe, impudent, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is very hard for him that hath no other meanes to prove his Church, and his faith, then by a Catalogue of names drawne out of Hiſtories, or other good Authors, to have any certainty of his Church, or faith, becauſe of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of many ages, and want of good Authors.</p>

Luſt backed with worldly power, mad,<note place="margin">Dormiebat, tunc planè (ut apparet) ſopore Chriſtus.</note> and franticke with a deſire of rule, challenged all unto her ſelfe.

was covered with the waves.<note place="margin">Iſta non vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulans.</note> I ſay, hee was aſleepe, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, as if hee did not ſee thoſe things, did ſuffer them ſo to be done, and did not riſe to vengeance.

And what kind of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and Deacon Cardinals, ſhall wee thinke were choſen by ſuch Monſters, ſeeing nothing is more firmly graffed in nature, then this, that like ſhould beget like?

You ſay, that Chriſt himſelfe, having but twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, had one devill amongſt them. But what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged here, doth ſhew, that divers of thoſe who ſupplied the place of Chriſt himſelfe, his Vicars generall upon earth, as you terme them, men to whom the Church is eſſentially joyned, and muſt be obedient, were devils, monſters, the dearlings of Whores, ſome of them Baſtard children of Popes, by theſe notorious Whores; and all their Prieſts, Deacons and Cardinals like themſelves, ſo Atheiſticall in their courſes and deſires, as to wiſh that Chriſt might ſleepe everlaſtingly, and never riſe to judgement: nay, the viſible government of the Roman Church, which you will have to be the onely Church, was not ſo much in them, as in theſe whores, who made and unmade Biſhops and Popes, without any regard of Canons, or Cuſtomes Eccleſiaſticall; and this wickednes was praevalent, not for a few years, or a few Popes, but for this whole Age, <hi>Toto hoc ſaeculo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baronius,</hi> which is for 100 yeares. Yet you Romaniſts will have all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world to behold, and to be led by the viſible Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16580:73"/>
Church, though the face, and whatſoever was viſible therein, was moſt foule and filthy, not onely in him who ſate in the Chaire of <hi>Peter,</hi> as you ſay; but alſo in all his Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in all his Deacons, Prieſts and Cardinals. But you will ſay, Theſe were no Popes; then will I ſay, that by your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, you had no Church: for the Pope is now a part of the definition of the Church with you, and therefore no Pope, no Church.

               </p>
               <p>Or will you ſay (for ſo <hi>Baronius</hi> doth) Shall any man, ſhall all men in the world pin their ſoules upon the ſleeves of ſuch Monſters? cleave unto them, and be obedient unto them, only becauſe they ſate in the Chaire, though uſurpingly?

               <p>All theſe are Latine Authors, acknowledged by you of the Roman Church for Orthodox, at leaſt two of them in every Age, which were ſufficient; but I can make it good for all, out of <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Surius, Hiltorpius,</hi> or Synods, allowed by your Church. Thus therefore I argue:
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Major:</hi> All orthodox, or right believing Chriſtians doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and profeſſe the Apoſtles Creed, the Bookes of old and new Teſtament, received for Canonicall by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16580:75"/>
of the first <hi>400</hi> yeares, together with the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, which the Proteſtants profeſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Minor:</hi> But theſe Authors aforenamed in my Catalogue, from the yeare <hi>800,</hi> to the yeare <hi>1500,</hi> are all orthodox, or right believing. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Concluſio.</hi> All theſe Authors aforenamed in my Catalogue, from the yeare <hi>800,</hi> to the yeare <hi>1500,</hi> doe receive, and profeſſe the Apoſtles Creed, the ſaid Bookes of the old and new Teſtament, the two Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, which the Proteſtants receive and profeſſe.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Or thus:
<q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Major:</hi> Whoſoever receive our whole Faith, and all our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are of our Church, and wee of theirs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Minor:</hi> But all theſe Authors receive our whole Faith, and all our Sacraments. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But you, having another Faith, a new Creed, new Articles cannot prove theſe, or any other to have held that your new Faith entirely; and I have ſhewed moſt of theſe Authors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to denie, ſome one, ſome another Article of your new Creed: ſo that a man may be orthodox, and yet denie your Faith, your Creed.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>No man can be ſaved that denieth the true Faith.</p>
                  <p>But many are ſaved who denie the Roman Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Roman Faith is not the true Faith.</p>
               </q>

                     <p>But thoſe Authors, as all others of the Greeke Church did profeſſe, and receive the ſaid Creed, Scriptures, Councels and Sacraments under lawfull Paſtors.</p>
                     <p>

                     <hi>A Catalogue of Councels Generall or</hi> Provinciall in all Ages, which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our Faith.</head>
                  <p>TO name particular men in all Ages, who did profeſſe our Faith, receive our Scriptures and Sacraments, is not to prove our Church extant in all Ages; for one man is not a Church, no more then one member, as hand, or foot is the body, or one Citizen is a Citie, or one ſubject is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I have therefore thought it fit, out of my many yeares reading, obſervation, and collection, to prove, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome particular men, but alſo whole Churches, that is, a ſocietie of many men profeſſing our Faith, Scripture, and Sacraments, have beene in all Ages: to this end, I have put downe a Catalogue of Councels in all Ages (which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are juſtly termed, The Church repreſentative) who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our Faith, Scriptures, and Sacraments, although the maine proofe is in that of Faith, which includeth the reſt: for this Faith hath no other object then the Scriptures Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, and receiveth no Sacraments but what are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures, and inſtituted by God. And becauſe all Councels did not record, nor publiſh all thoſe things which were done of courſe, and obſerved at the opening, and in the beginning of every Councell; I thought it would prove ſatisfactorie to the Reader, that he ſhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how they never began Councels without ſolemn Prayers, or Maſſe, as the Romaniſts call it: and that in every Maſſe our Creed is repeated, as appeareth by their Miſſals, and thoſe Authors in the Margin, which are Expoſitors of the Maſſe: ſo that ſeeing our Creed is profeſſed in every Maſſe, and all Councels begin with a ſolemne Maſſe, it followeth, that all Councels did profeſſe our Faith. Yea, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I will adde other proofes; as 1, an Injunction that it ſhould be ſo. 2. Hiſtoricall teſtimonie that it was ſo.

                     <p>You baptize Children daily in your Church, and then you profeſſe my Faith, the Apoſtles Creed, and miniſter our firſt Sacrament. You have your Maſſe or Common Prayer, with the Communion often in your Churches, then alſo you profeſſe my Faith; reade parcels of our Scriptures, and miniſter our other Sacrament intire to the Clergie, though by halfes to the Laitie. You have publiſhed many Miſſals under the names of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> and others, every one of theſe allow and uſe my Faith, Scriptures and Sacraments.

But as for your Creed, it was never profeſſed in Baptiſme; it is found in none of thoſe Miſſals, nor in your <hi>Ordo Romanus,</hi> nor in any of thoſe Expoſitors of your Roman Maſſe for one thouſand five hundred yeares. Let mee conclude with the words of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis;</hi> The holy Church a diligent, and wary keeper of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which were committed unto her, doth not change, adde, or diminiſh any thing therein; it doth not cut off any thing that is neceſſary, nor adde any thing that is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; it doth not loſe that which is proper to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor uſurpe that which belongeth to other Sects of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world.</p>

That they that are in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, muſt prove, and not thoſe who are in the negative; but which ſeemeth to follow, that a man who had time out of minde quietly poſſeſſed his land, or Religion, were bound to prove his right, before his upſtart Adverſary who denyeth him to have right, have given a good reaſon of his denyall. 3. That what was not a point of faith in the Primitive Ages, cannot after be a point of faith; as if there were not ſome points which were at firſt not held neceſſary to be beleeved even by Orthodox fathers, which afterward by examination, and definition of the Church in Generall Councels, were made ſo neceſſary to be beleeved, as that whoſoever did not beleeve them were accounted not Orthodox, but Hereticks. And 4, that the Anabaptiſt faith is that which is contained in Scripture and ancient Creeds: And the Anabaptiſt Church is a ſocietie of men which profeſſeth the faith contained in Scripture, and the ancient Creeds, as (if an Anabaptiſt may be Iudge) it will be held ſo to be.</p>

               <p>This is the firſt of my grounds that he finds fault with, but not in that order as I placed them, but after two, or three other grounds of mine, which in mine anſwer, were placed after this. Thus he to puzzle the Reader, that he may not ſo eaſily perceive what he doth anſwer, what he doth not anſwer, never obſerves order. Yet I, that he may in nothing eſcape my hands, will follow him in his order, ſo that I muſt anſwer what he objecteth againſt this ground in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>My next ground was this.</p>
               <p>I diſtinguiſh between <list>

               </p>
               <p>Our Negation is partly a traverſing, partly a condemning of your novelties, and additions, and therefore no part of our faith: for no man will deny his owne faith. To this my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary doth thus reply.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>That faith is affirmation, and not negation; by which Rule it ſeemeth he would not have any negative propoſitions, although found in Scripture, to pertaine to faith.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>You inferre that in your concluſion, which is not in my grounds; I ſay that faith is affirmation, I doe not ſay that all that doth pertaine to Faith, is affirmation; I ſay that negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are no part of my faith: you ſay that negations doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to faith. <hi>Non facis elenchum,</hi> you inferre not my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in your concluſion with a contradiction; what you ſay, is not contrary to my grounds, for that may pertaine to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16580:86"/>
faith, which is not faith; and that may pertaine to faith, which is no part of faith; as that may pertaine to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> which is not Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> nor any part of Maſter <hi>Fiſher.</hi> The button of Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> doublet, doth pertaine to Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> yet I may not ſay Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> is a button, or that this button is any part of Maſter <hi>Fiſher.</hi> A joyned ſtoole may pertaine to Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> but I will not ſay Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> is a joyn'd ſtoole. The diſtinction of matters of faith out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and others of that which belongs unto faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, from that which belongs unto faith accidentally, doth exclude thoſe things which onely pertaine unto faith, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, or any part of faith; You know Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ariſtot. Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barella.</note> that <hi>Propoſitiones per ſe habent eſſentialem connexionem:</hi> Man is that which he is of himſelfe properly, and eſſentially, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſting of a humane body, and a reaſonable ſoule; not that which is accidentall unto man, as to be blacke or white, to be a Muſician, to be a Carpenter, to be a Fryer, or a Prieſt, a Jeſuite, or a Dominican; Theſe things are not man, nor any part of man. It doth not therefore follow, that becauſe nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pertaine to faith, therefore they are faith, or part of faith. Your Argument from Scripture, if I ſhould grant your <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> cannot inferre againſt my ground, altering part of faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which pertaineth to faith. Your Argument in forme will diſcover it ſelfe to be a fallacie.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>All propoſitions found in Scripture pertaine to faith. Some negative propoſitions are found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> (If you inferre againſt me, your concluſion muſt be thus) Negative propoſitions are faith, or parts of faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is no Syllogiſme, here are foure termes; there is that in the concluſion, which is not in the premiſſes: but if you would have all propoſitions that are in Scripture to be matters of faith, or parts, or points of faith, then I deny your <hi>major;</hi> you know there are many propoſitions in Scripture delivered by wicked men, yea, ſome by the Devill himſelfe, As that which was ſpoken unto <hi>Eve,</hi> you ſhall not die. Whereas God told them they ſhould die, if they did eate of the forbidden
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16580:87"/>
fruit. And ſhall theſe be parts of your faith? will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Devill when he ſpeaketh againſt God? But of this I have ſpoken more fully before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> proving the contrary to this out of your own men; Yet I will here adde ſome few reaſons, to ſhew that Negations, or negative Propoſitions cannot be Articles of faith, or Principles of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. c. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth prove by two Arguments, that an affirmative propoſition is better then a negative.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the affirmative is better knowne then the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, for the negative cannot be knowne without the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, but the affirmative may without the negative; as the habit may be defined without privation, but not privation without the habit; as ſeeing may be defined without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blindneſſe, but blindneſſe cannot be defined without mention of ſeeing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Affirmation doth ſpeake of being, Negation of not being; but being is better then not being. To the ſame effect in his bookes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note>

                  </gap>. Affirmation is before privation. He is the ſame man in his Metaphiſicks, where he putteth Negations, <hi>inter entia rationis,</hi> which have no being in themſelves: if no being, how can they be principles in any Scicence, much leſſe in Divinitie?

               </p>
               <p>This is the Doctrine of your great Schooleman <hi>Aquinas:</hi> He was one of your greateſt Divines, who ſaid at your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that no true Negative hath in it ſelfe, the cauſe of his truth, but is ſo by the trutth of an affirmative. Negations as negations, <hi>nullam omninò dicunt entitatem, ſed ſolam abſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ejus quod negatur;</hi> they tell of no being, but onely an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that which is denyed, ſaith your <hi>Fonſeca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then that Propoſitions of faith, are principles, and principles cannot be proved, by any thing that is before them, or better knowne then they; and that nothing can be known
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16580:87"/>
without reall being, and that negations are proved by affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; how can they be Propoſitions, or principles of faith? And leſt you ſhould wander in your Replie, I will preſſe two Arguments out of your owne men.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Propoſitions of faith are foundations, and a foundation muſt be poſitive, or it will beare nothing upon it: go round about a building, and ſay a thouſand times over, here is no ſtone, and here is no ſtone, and ſo all along, you will never lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Shall the Maſon by ſaying, I will not lay this, nor that foundation, come and claime his wages? Shall the Tyler by laying on no Tyle, ſay that he hath covered the houſe? or the Carpenter, by ſquaring and joyning no Timber, build the Walls?</p>
               <p>The Articles of our faith are in the Apoſtles Creed, all affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and poſitive, there is not one Negation among them.</p>
               <p>The queſtion betweene us is about unwritten Traditions, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Tranſubſtantiation, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, and the reſt before alleadged out of <hi>Paulus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus</hi> his Creed; all which I deny, and therefore are no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of my faith, for no man would deny his owne faith. All thoſe we deny, we lay no ſuch foundation, let them which have laid it, maintaine it. We are contented that Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, worſhipping of Images, Indulgences, &amp;c. be buried in oblivion, and never mentioned amongſt us, which we would not doe, if they were Articles of our faith, for all men ought to be ready to confeſſe, and profeſſe their faith. It was truely written by one of your owne, Doctor <hi>Iames Gordon Hanley</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Ieſuite,<note place="margin">In Lib. de Traditioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> that the whole Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you, and us, is of the unwritten points of faith, which you affirme, and we deny: as for example, you affirme and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16580:88"/>
beleeve Purgatorie, I doe not beleeve it; will you ſay now that Purgatory is a part of my faith? can that be a part of a mans faith, which he doth not beleeve? If I doe not beleeve it, it is not my faith, if it be my faith, I doe beleeve it ſo. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Tranſubſtantiation, I doe not beleeve it, can this be a point of my faith? Your Schoole ſaith truely, that to beleeve is the proper, internall, inſeparable act of faith, they goe together, they ſtand, or fall together: So that I wonder with what face, with what braine, you can ſay, or thinke, that thoſe negations are points of my faith, and I ſay they are not? Yet leſt you ſhould not take my word, I will adde one reaſon more. I ſay with the learned of both ſides, that faith is <hi>habitus principiorum,</hi> is that aſſent we give unto revealed principles.

               <p>This Rule was not framed by mee, but it was the Rule of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> and ſo alleaged by mee in my Anſwer, confirmed alſo by their great Schoolman <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then cited out of both, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religion, or points of Faith are without addition, as</hi> Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis <hi>ſaith.</hi> Imitetur animarum Religio rationem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum, quae &amp; quot parvulorum membra tot viro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp;c. <hi>And as</hi> Aquinas <hi>ſaith;</hi>

               <q>
                  <p>That which was no point of Faith for the first <hi>1200</hi> yeares, could be none afterwards; <hi>ut ſupra Vinc. Lirin. &amp; Aquin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Tranſubſtantiation was no point of Faith before the yeare <hi>1200. Scotus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> Tranſubſtantiation is no point of Faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To all this, contained in my former Anſwer, is no Reply made: the Authoritie and ſaying of <hi>Lirinenſis, Aquinas, Scotus,</hi> together with my Argument, are paſt over with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but ſupplied with two or three falſhoods; 1, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I framed that Rule which was framed 1200 yeares at leaſt before I was borne. 2, By calling that a falſe Rule, which was received without controll, no learned man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the face to denie it, till the lame <hi>Laiola</hi> furniſhed the world with audacious Jeſuits: for never was there a new Creed made before the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> But let us ſee
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16580:89"/>
what reaſon hee hath to denie this Rule? His words are theſe:</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>As if there were not ſome points which were at first, not held neceſſarie to be believed by orthodox Fathers, which afterward by examination and definition of the Church in Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, were made ſo neceſſarie to be believed, as that whoſoever did not believe, were accounted not Orthodox, but Haereticks.</p>

               <p>A Boy that wanted a couple of Verſes to make up his full number, deſired one of his fellowes to helpe at a pinch, no matter whether it were to the Theme, no matter whether they were good or no, ſo they fill'd up the Paper, made up the number: I care not (ſaith he) though they be all botches, for I hope they will never be read. One of his fellowes, to helpe him at his need, made this Verſe:

               <p>My Adverſarie at the firſt made a ſhort weake Anſwer to what I had written, ſuch as gave no ſatisfaction to his owne ſide: (for ſo Maſter <hi>Waterhouſe,</hi> who brought mee that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, told mee.) Being afterwards called upon to make a more full and more ſatisfactorie Anſwer, either by himſelfe, or ſome other of his fellowes, made up this, not ſo full as he ſhould, for hee paſſeth by more then halfe my grounds and Arguments with ſilence. And that which hee hath anſwered is botched up with impertinencies and fallacies, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of thoſe botches I have ſhewed before: as, <hi>Who doth not ſee? I doe not ſee: Maſter</hi> Rogers <hi>may grant: If Maſter</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <hi>doe grant: I ſee no reaſon why he ſhould not grant, &amp;c. And here to my grounds, by which it ſeemeth hee would not: To my first ground, by which it ſeemeth to follow: To my ſecond ground, as if there were not ſome points, &amp;c. To my third ground, and to the fourth: As (if an Anabaptiſt may judge) it will be held ſo to be: And to my fifth: Hee may be yet further allowed to reject, &amp;c.</hi> Here is neither granting, nor denying, nor diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16580:90"/>
nor arguing, but all is <hi>Seeming,</hi> and, <hi>As if it were;</hi> all concurring to make his learning Sophiſtrie, and himſelfe a Sophiſter,<note place="margin">Ariſt. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lench.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Sophiſtrie is ſeeming wiſdome, and a Sophiſter is hee that ſeeketh for gaine by ſeeming wiſdome, whereas there is no ſuch matter: and where hee ſeemeth to argue, it is but the contentious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a Sophiſter, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; conſiſting of nothing but ſeeming probabilities, as I have ſhewed in all inſtances which I have met with yet, and ſo will in this. My third ground was, That what was no point of Faith in the Primitive Ages, could be none after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; <hi>ut ſuprà Vincentius Lirinenſis, &amp; Aquinas.</hi> What ſaith hee to this? doth hee grant it? doth he diſtinguiſh? doth he denie it? No grant, no diſtinction, no direct deniall, for that hee dares not, leaſt hee ſhould denie that ancient Father, and his great Schoolman: yet hee ſaith ſomething againſt it, or rather maketh as if hee would. Hee ſaith, that ſome points were defined by Councels, and ſo made neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, which before were not held neceſſary, even by ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Fathers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church may make new points, or Articles of Faith.</p>
               <p>His Argument and his Antecedent be both falſe; his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is ambiguous: for to believe, may ſignifie an act ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of humane Faith, or religious divine Faith. If hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand believe in the firſt ſenſe, I grant his Antecedent, <hi>viz.</hi> That wee are to give great credit unto the Decrees and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Generall Councels; but yet inferior to that credit wee give unto the Word of God, becauſe he is Truth it ſelfe, who cannot erre, and they are man who may erre. And therefore to take this, <hi>viz</hi> That the Definitions of Councels are Articles of Faith, thence to prove that wee have new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, beſides thoſe of the Primitive Church, is <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio principii,</hi> a begging of that for granted, which he knowes wee denie:<note place="margin">

there is a two-fold neceſſitie of different degrees: <list>

This later may belong to the Decrees of Councels, not the former.</p>
               <p>Here you might have remembred my diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <list>

               <p>Definitions of Councels are Church Doctrines, not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith; and therefore have an inferiour neceſſitie, without the knowledge whereof a man may be ſaved: and thouſands were ſaved before thoſe Councels were heard of; but no man can be ſaved without the Doctrines of Faith, knowne and profeſſed by himſelfe, if hee be in yeares of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, or by his Parents and Sureties if hee be a child.</p>

               <p>And fourthly, that the Anabaptist Faith is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, and the ancient Creeds; and the Anabaptiſts Church is a ſocietie of men, which profeſſeth the Faith contained in Scripture, and the ancient Creeds: as (if an Anabaptiſt may be judge) it will be held ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I will grant, that the Anabaptiſt is a member of the viſible Church, <hi>Eccleſia verae, quamvis non ſanae:</hi> and that Church to have beene alwaies in Ages whereof hee is a member; yea <hi>Membrum verum, quamvis non ſanum;</hi> a true member, though a diſeaſed, as a goutie foot of a man, that is otherwiſe in health, and ſixtie or ſeventie yeares old, is a true member, though not a ſound member of that body which in all other parts is ſound; and this foot thus gouty, though it became gouty but within a few daies before, may truly ſay, that that body whereof it is a member, hath beene 10, 20, 30, 40, 70 yeares the very ſame body which now it is, the very ſame eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, though not accidentally; ſtill a body, and ſtill the ſame body, though ſometimes more healthy then other, and in ſome parts more ſound then other. Now Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> to what end is your great diſcourſe of Anabaptiſts, ſeeing I grant him to be of the Church? If hee be ſuch a one as you ſuppoſe him, who agreeth with mee in all things elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Scripture, in the Creed, in the Sacraments, in the eſſence of the Sacraments, in their matter and forme, in their force and efficacie; onely differs from mee in the circumſtance of time, namely, when Baptiſme is to be conferred, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Children of Chriſtians, whether before, or after they are come to yeares of diſcretion.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND fifthly, That having diſtinguiſhed Faith (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth) into Doctrines fundamentall, and neceſſary, and Doctrines not fundamentall, but acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, or not neceſſary: hee may be yet further allowed to reject all Church authoritie, and not to be ſatisfied with what is taught by any Church, ours or his owne, (as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth hee is unſatisfied) and conſequently being left to his owne libertie, may apply this diſtinction as hee ſhall pleaſe, accounting onely that to be neceſſary which hee liſteth ſo to account. I wiſh, I ſay, that ſuch an Anabaptiſt were imagined, and that Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> were to be his opponent: That it might be ſeene whether this Anabaptiſt could not as well by theſe aforeſaid Rules, Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Diſtinctions, affirme, prove and defend his Faith and Church to have beene alwaies viſible, againſt Maſter <hi>Rogers;</hi> as Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth, or can by his Rules, Definitions and Diſtinctions, affirme, prove, and defend the Proteſtant Church to have beene alwaies viſible, againſt Catholicks: or whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Rogers</hi> could better convince ſuch an Anabaptiſt not to have the ancient Faith, or not to be a member of the continuall viſible Church, then a Catholicke can convince Maſter <hi>Rogers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Diſtinction, I have ſpoken afore, that ſome Doctrines are more neceſſary then others: now let us ſee whether this man ſaith any thing againſt it, and what it is. I doe not find hee doth denie it, or grant it: ſo that I know not what hee meanes by the words following, <hi>viz. He may be yet further allowed to reject all Church authoritie, and not be ſatisfied with what is taught by any Church, ours or his owne (as Maſter</hi> Rogers <hi>confeſſeth he is unſatisfied.)</hi> Firſt, you mightily falſifie this Parentheſis upon mee, my words were theſe; I doe confeſſe, that none of your ſide or ours have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me full ſatisfaction in this point: what are <hi>res fidei per ſe?</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:16580:92"/>
And in the words next going before, I ſaid thus; Maſter <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher,</hi> I deſire you alſo, for the avoiding of confuſion, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your opinion: Whether all the Affirmative Doctrines of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> are matters of Faith <hi>per ſe,</hi> funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, and neceſſarie to be held for ſalvation <hi>fide explicita.</hi> I ſpeake <hi>de adultis quibus facultas datur diſcendi,</hi> who being come to yeares of diſcretion, have capacitie to learne.</p>
               <p>This much in my firſt Anſwer; to this my requeſt he makes no reply; either hee is ignorant, or dare not expreſſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the affirmative doctrines of his Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> are matters of Faith, and neceſſary to be knowne and believed: though I then told him I propoſed this queſtion, as deſirous to learn. This much concerning my queſtion, and my requeſt. Now to my Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That none of his ſide or ours, hath given me full ſatisfaction herein: he hence infers, that I am unſatisfied without any limitation; or if wee will looke backe beyond the Parentheſis, as if I were unſatisfied in that which is taught in any Church, ours or his. This is the right fallacie, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter:</hi> I ſaid I was ſatisfied by none of theirs or ours, in the inſtances of one diſtinction, what Doctrines were to be reduced to either member of the Diſtinction, namely, what Doctrines were neceſſary, what not neceſſary; what was fundamentall, what acceſſory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what matter of Faith properly, what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally: and hee would traduce mee, as if I were unſatisfied in all other Doctrines; this is the Devils Logicke, Maſter <hi>Fiſher,</hi> who is the father of lies, to ſay I confeſſed that I never did. As well I might prove that you have never a noſe on your face, or that you are blind, thus:

                     <p>As you ſay, Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> doth confeſſe hee is unſatisfied in ſome things belonging to one diſtinction.</p>

                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:16580:97"/>What I require of you I will performe on our ſide, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is affirmative in our Articles, I will maintaine to be affirmed, and taught in all Ages, as the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Articles, the Affirmative part of the 6, the 7, 8, and ſo in the reſt, or I will yeeld unto you.</p>
               <p>Give me inſtance what Affirmation of our Articles you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and I will prove it in all Ages.

               <p>I will doe the like by you, and give you an inſtance in our Affirmatives, Shew me who in every Age did receive the bookes of <hi>Eſdras, Machabees, Tobit, Iudith, &amp;c.</hi> for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in the 1, 2, 3, 4, Centurie of yeares; This is one of the firſt points of your Tridentine faith.</p>

Divinity, as all other Sciences, conſiſteth of Principles, and Concluſions; the Principles received on both ſides, are the Scriptures (to which you would adde unwritten Traditions) you bring not one place of Scripture to maintaine thoſe Affirmative Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of yours, which we deny, you account Articles of faith. And as for Theologicall concluſions, you inferre none; you frame no Argument, you make no Syllogiſme, you give no reaſon of your faith, though Saint <hi>Peter</hi> require it whom I thought of all the Apoſtles you did moſt reſpect; what ſhall we thinke then, but that you have neither Scripture, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for your faith, I meane in your new Creed in which you diſſent from us.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>I require withall that he give me a ſubſtantiall ground well proved out of Scripture, why thoſe perticular points which he ſhall aſsigne, are points of Proteſtant faith, rather then others contained in the 39. Articles; if he ſay (as he hath already ſeemed to ſay) that none of their Negative Doctrines, pertaine to their faith, and that all that is affirmed by Proteſtants, is affirmed by Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and that this Affirmative Doctrine onely doth pertaine to faith, it will follow that Proteſtants have no faith different from <hi>Roman Catholikes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>He calleth unto me to diſtinguiſh between points of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant faith, and other points contained in the 39 Articles and yet in the next word he is faine to confeſſe that I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed (if he ſay, as he hath already ſeemed to ſay) that none of their Negative Doctrines, pertaine unto their faith. This I had delivered in my firſt Anſwer, and yet he ſtill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for it, yet he muſt mince it a little, and ſay, I ſeemed to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16580:98"/>
ſay; ſo great a friend he is to ſeeming, that he will never leave it, knowing it to be eſſentiall to the definition of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, and a Sophiſter.</p>
               <p>You might have left out your ſeeming, and written plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I ſaid ſo; ſeeing in my Anſwer to your firſt Paper, I ſpent nere a page in explicating, and exemplifying this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and in my Anſwer to your ſecond Paper, which was delivered me as the worke of five Jeſuites, then conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about <hi>Gondamors</hi> houſe: I wrote thus;
<q>
                     <p>As I did admoniſh Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> to diſtinguiſh betweene Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and Negation, ſo I doe theſe men, and that faith is Affirmation, not Negation, for no man beleeveth what he denieth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In points of faith I like Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> Rule.</p>
                     <p>They that are in the Affirmative muſt prove.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now all that we affirme, they affirme; as one God, three perſons, all the Creed. So that we need not prove what our Adverſaries do confeſſe.</p>
               <p>But in thoſe points in variance between us, they are to prove; becauſe they are Affirmative, we Negative: as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, Latine Service, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c. Thus farre in my former Anſwer. This is ſaying plainly, this is not ſeeming. Whereas you inferre, that ſeeing all which is affirmed by Proteſtants, is affirmed by <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and this Affirmative Doctrine onely doth pertaine to faith, it will follow that Proteſtants have no faith dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes. I grant the Conſequence; what is this to the queſtion, whether we are of the viſible Church or no? this which you would inferre, doth rather prove us to be a part of the viſible Church, then any way gaine-ſay it. Thus
<q>
                     <p>They which have no other faith then that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are parts of the viſible Church.</p>
                     <p>But the Proteſtants have no other faith then that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo:</hi> The Proteſtants are a part of the viſible Church.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> Maſter <hi>Fiſher</hi> would inferre out of my Grounds
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16580:98"/>
as if I would deny it; no, I grant it, and ſo I hope will he the <hi>major,</hi> then the concluſion muſt follow.</p>
               <p>We differ from you in Eccleſiaſticall Doctrines, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which you terme to be points of faith, but we deny.</p>
               <p>They are corruptions of faith, Innovations, Idolatrous, Antichriſtian Doctrines. You would force them upon us, as points of faith; we refuſe them, becauſe the Scripture doth not expreſſe them, the Primitve Church did not know them, and the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Church to this day doth not approve them; And your owne writers are diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into many and divers opinions concerning them.<note place="margin">Paulus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. l. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; <hi>2</hi>

               <p>I am ſure you will hold this Concluſion to be falſe, if ſo then, one of the premiſſes muſt be falſe, not the <hi>minor, ergo,</hi> the <hi>major,</hi> which is your Tenet whereby you would proue us to be Hereticks, and to deny the faith.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Out of which it will further follow, that thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants who ſhall hold ſome of the <hi>39</hi> Articles, and deny the reſt may be ſaid to have no faith different from thoſe which ſubſcribe to all the <hi>39</hi> Articles.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>I grant it doth follow, ſo that thoſe ſame Articles which they deny, be not thoſe Articles which concerne the Unity of the Godhead, the Trinitie of perſons, and all thoſe things which are contained in the Creed; I ſay therefore they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Eccleſiaſticall Doctrines, or Diſcipline, not in faith, ſo they receive the Scriptures and Apoſtles Creed.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>And why not <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks by as good, or better right account Proteſtants (who deny ſo many points defined in both ancient, and recent Generall Councels) to be Hereticks Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and no members of the Ancient, and preſent Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>If we did the one, you may doe the other: but I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the falſhood of your ſuppoſition, that we count them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, who diſcent from us in any of our Articles, they may be erroneous in a leſſer nature then Hereſie, &amp; turbulent in thoſe errours; they may be Schiſmaticks diſobedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Government, and ſo excommunicated, and impriſoned for either of thoſe, without Hereſie.</p>
               <p>If all Decrees of Councels be Doctrines of faith, as you affirme, your Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is deceived who ſaith that in Councels the greateſt part of thoſe things which are done doe not belong to faith, neither the Diſputations concerning faith, nor the reaſons which are added, nor thoſe things which are brought for explication, and illuſtration, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very naked Decrees, and not all thoſe, but they alone who are propoſed as matters of faith.

               <p>As you have falſified the predicate of my Propoſition, by changing points of faith unto that which pertaineth unto faith, fundamentall into acceſſory; proper, and eſſentiall into that which is accidentall; ſo have you falſified the ſubject of the ſame Propoſition: for immediately after that diſtinction of Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Negation, my words were theſe; In thoſe Articles of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, our Negation is partly a traverſing, partly a condemning of your novelties, and additions, and therfore no part of our faith, for no man would deny his owne faith. Thus farre in my former Anſwer, as alſo in a few lines after, my words were theſe, The firſt inſtance of Negation in our Articles, is part of the ſixth Article concerning thoſe Bookes of <hi>Eſdras, Tobit, Iudith, &amp;c.</hi> whereby it appeareth manifeſtly, that I ſpake not of Negatives revealed in Scripture, but of Negatives in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines Eccleſiaſticall. Now that you ſhould argue from Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in Scripture to Negatives out of Scripture, is <hi>à baculo ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulum</hi> from the ſtaffe to the corner, my Tenet therefore is that,</p>
               <p>Negatives revealed in Scripture are <hi>res fidei</hi>

               <p>That which you alleadge out of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> I willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, I receive his Creed, I have often profeſſed it in publicke, but what is that to your new Creed? I finde in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, neither Purgatory, nor Indulgence, nor Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor Invocation of Saints, nor ſeven Sacraments, nor worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images.</p>
               <p>Wheras you ſay I muſt hold it in the uncorrupted ſenſe of the

Catholike Church, I doe imbrace it, but I will not underſtand the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Pope for the Catholike Church as you doe. The Catholike Church never received your Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, your halfe Communion, your worſhipping of Images, as I have ſhewed already; I will obſtinately maintaine nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the known judgement of a lawfull Generall Councell, but your Councels of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Lateran</hi> are no ſuch, they are but fopperies, and the jugling tricks of the Popiſh faction to cozen the world. Whatſoever we deny, when you prove it out of Scripture, we will beleeve it; here is no obſtinacie. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is determined by Councels, we will receive, <hi>fide humana,</hi> but not <hi>divina,</hi> as the ſaying of Reverend men, but not as the Oracles of God. So alſo we approve the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, in receiving all revealed truth, we are farre from Hereſie: in ſubmitting to the Catholike Church, and Decrees of Councels, we clear our ſelves from being Schiſmatikes: in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, we ſhew our ſelves to be no Innovators; but you by worſhipping of Images, ſhew what reſpect you have to Scripture; by your new Creed you ſhew what reverence you have to Generall Councels, ſeeing the Councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> decreed, having repeated that which is commonly called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed,<note place="margin">Iſidor. fol. <hi>83</hi> and urged by the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the Councell of Florence.

By the <hi>Graecians,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Poſevine</hi> your owne Jeſuite; by the <hi>Indians,</hi> as is acknowledged by the ſame Author; by the <hi>Coftie</hi> of Aegypt, and conſequently by all the reſt of the <hi>Iacobites</hi> the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and others acknowledging all ſubjection unto the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſo that upon you alone that curſe is fallen.</p>
               <q>Nec amet quenquam, nec ametur ab vllo.</q>
               <p>You hate, you condemne all Churches of the World; and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16580:102"/>
they condemne you, you account them for Schiſmaticks, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and they you for Schiſmaticks, Hereticks and Idolaters; your worſhipping of Images, hinder the converſion of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> who for this cauſe eſteeme you for ſubtill Atheiſts, and heatheniſh Idolaters, falling downe to a blocke, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the worke of mens hands. We worſhip God.</p>
               <p>Fiſher.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore it is certaine that Proteſtants hold divers Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Doctrines, not onely not found in, but contrary to Scriptures, Councels, and Fathers, and other Orthodox Authors in all Ages; It evidently followeth, that Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> hath not yet named, nor can name, nor hath proved, nor can prove, or defend any of thoſe he named, or undertaketh to name, to have beene viſible Proteſtants in all Ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> and conſequently he cannot be ſaid to have made any good anſwer, either to Maſter <hi>Fiſhers</hi> Queſtion, or to his five Propoſitions, or to his other Paper, written to explicate the ſenſe of the ſaid Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Rogers.</p>
               <p>What you ſay, certainely is moſt falſe, that Proteſtants hold divers Negative Doctrines contrary to Scriptures, Councels, and Fathers, if you underſtand Generall Councels, and unanimous conſent of Fathers. We hold many Doctrines not expreſly ſet downe in Scriptures, but none contrary to Scriptures, neither doe we count any thing matter of faith, but what is expreſly contained in Scriptures. Whereas you ſay, that I have not yet named, nor proved Authors of the Proteſtants faith in all Ages, the preſent diſcourſe will ſhew to be falſe, which I referre to the Reader.</p>
